<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
Privacy is defined as a voluntary withdrawal from society. While
everyone needs some degree of privacy, we currently know little about
people’s privacy needs. In this study, we explore the relations between
the need for privacy and personality. Personality will be
operationalized using the HEXACO personality inventory. Need for privacy
will be measured in relation to social, psychological, and physical
privacy from other individuals (horizontal privacy); need for privacy
from government agencies and companies (vertical privacy); as well as
need for informational privacy, anonymity, and general privacy (both
horizontal and vertical privacy). A sample of 1,576 respondents
representative of the U.S. in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity will
be collected. The correlations between privacy, personality, and
sociodemographics will be analyzed using structural equation modeling.

<!-- The increasing digitization of everyday life has catapulted  -->
<!-- which has led to several sweeping societal changes such as the commodification and monetization of personal information [@sevignaniPrivacyCapitalismAge2016],  -->
<p>Privacy is a major topic of public discourse and academic interest
<span class="citation">(Dienlin and Breuer 2023)</span>. Yet despite its
importance, to date we still know surprisingly little about the relation
between privacy and personality <span class="citation">(Masur 2018,
155)</span>.
<!-- Why do some people desire more and some people desire less privacy? -->
What can we infer about a person if they desire more privacy? Are they
more introverted, more risk-averse, or more traditional?
<!-- Or do they have more to hide? --> Asking these questions seems
relevant, not least because people who desire more privacy are often
regarded with suspicion, having to justify why they want to be left
alone. Consider the “nothing-to-hide” argument <span
class="citation">(Solove 2007)</span>, which is that people who oppose
state surveillance only do so because they have something to
hide—because if you have nothing to hide, you would have nothing to
fear. Is it true that people who desire more privacy are also more
dishonest, greedy, or unfair? Or are people simply less extraverted,
more diligent, or more prudent? With this paper, we seek to answer the
following question: What can we learn about a person’s personality if
they say they desire more privacy?</p>
<!-- This study therefore seeks to understand how the need for privacy is related to dimensions and facets of personality. -->
<!-- It states that data mining and surveillance by government entities poses no threat to the privacy of law-abiding citizens, and is only problematic for people who are engaged in illegal activities who want to hide their information [@soloveVeGotNothing2007, p. 753]. -->
<!-- Summarized as “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear”, it implies that people who desire more privacy are also more likely to be involved in incriminating activities.  -->
<!-- It is true that people who commit crimes and who are insincere would indeed benefit from greater privacy.  -->
<!-- However, there exist many alternative reasons as to why people feel a greater or lesser need for privacy.  -->
<!-- Among those reasons are dispositional explanations.  -->
<!-- For example, people who need more privacy may be simply more introverted, hesitant, or prudent.  -->
<!-- A better understanding of the relation between personality and privacy is thus useful to illuminate the full range of human motivation for desiring privacy, and thus understanding individual decision-making and behavior surrounding personal privacy.  -->
<!-- Several theories argue that personality determines privacy behaviors [@masurSituationalPrivacySelfdisclosure2018, p. 155].  -->
<!-- However, to date there is almost no empirical research that can be used to develop well-informed hypotheses.  -->
<div id="privacy-and-personality" class="section level2">
<h2>Privacy and Personality</h2>
<!-- We first outline our own understanding of privacy, because the theoretical concept of privacy is multidisciplinary, complicated, and contested [@nissenbaumPrivacyContextTechnology2010, p. 71].  -->
<p>Privacy captures a <em>withdrawal</em> from others or from society in
general <span class="citation">(Westin 1967)</span>. This withdrawal
happens <em>voluntarily</em>, and it is under a person’s
<em>control</em> <span class="citation">(Westin 1967)</span>. Privacy is
also multi-dimensional. On the broadest level, we can differentiate the
two dimensions of horizontal and vertical privacy <span
class="citation">(Schwartz 1968; Masur, Teutsch, and Dienlin
2018)</span>. Whereas horizontal privacy captures withdrawal from other
people or peers, vertical privacy addresses withdrawal from superiors or
institutions (e.g., government agencies or businesses). In her
theoretical analysis, <span class="citation">Burgoon (1982)</span>
argued that privacy has four more specific dimensions: informational,
social, psychological, and physical privacy. <span
class="citation">Pedersen (1979)</span> conducted an empirical factor
analysis of 94 privacy-related items, finding six dimensions of privacy:
reserve (“unwillingness to be with and talk with others, especially
strangers,” p. 1293); isolation (“desire to be alone and away from
others,” p. 1293), solitude (“being alone by oneself and free from
observation by others,” p. 1293), intimacy with friends (“being alone
with friends,” p. 1293), intimacy with family (“being alone with members
of one’s own family,” p. 1293), and anonymity (“wanting to go unnoticed
in a crowd and not wishing to be the center of group attention,”
p. 1293).
<!-- The need for privacy, then, captures "[a]n individual’s need to selectively control the access of others to the individual self with the aim of achieving a desired level of physical or psychological privacy [...]") [@trepteNeedPrivacy2017, p.1].  -->
<!-- Finally, one can also distinguish between the objective privacy context (e.g., how many users can actually read a post on an SNS?), subjective privacy perceptions (e.g., how many users people _think_ can read a post on an SNS?), and resulting privacy behaviors (e.g., how much do people self-disclose?) [@dienlinPrivacyProcessModel2014]. -->
Building on these understandings of privacy, in this study we employ a
multifaceted model of need for privacy. We focus on <em>vertical</em>
privacy with regard to people’s felt need for withdrawal from
surveillance by a) the government and b) private companies;
<em>horizontal</em> privacy in terms of the perceived need for (c)
psychological, (d) social and/or (e) physical withdrawal from other
people; and <em>general</em> privacy as captured by people’s felt need
for (f) informational privacy, (g) anonymity, and (h) privacy in
general. Although all of these dimensions were defined and established
in prior research, combining these dimensions into one single
comprehensive measure of privacy represents a novel approach.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that various understandings of personality exist, we
operationalize personality using the factors and facets of the HEXACO
inventory of personality <span class="citation">(Lee and Ashton
2018)</span>. HEXACO is a large and comprehensive operationalization of
personality, and thus is less likely to miss potentially relevant
aspects than other operationalizations. The HEXACO model stands in the
tradition of the Big Five approach <span class="citation">(John and
Srivastava 1999)</span>.
<!-- and represents a broad understanding of personality--> It includes
six factors (discussed below), which have four specific facets each. In
addition, the HEXACO model includes a sixth factor not present in the
Big Five labeled honesty-humility (plus a meta-facet called altruism),
which seem particularly well-suited to investigate the
nothing-to-hide-argument.</p>
<p>In predicting the need for privacy, we will primarily focus on the
facets, because it is unlikely that the very specific need for privacy
dimensions will relate closely to more general personality factors <span
class="citation">(Bansal, Zahedi, and Gefen 2010; Junglas, Johnson, and
Spitzmüller 2008)</span>. And for reasons of scope, below we cannot
discuss all four facets for all six factors. Instead, we focus on those
we consider most relevant. However, all we be analyzed empirically.</p>
</div>
<div id="predicting-the-need-for-privacy" class="section level2">
<h2>Predicting the Need for Privacy</h2>
<p>So far, only few studies have analyzed the relation between
personality and need for privacy empirically <span
class="citation">(Hosman 1991; Pedersen 1982, see below)</span>.
Moreover, we are not aware of a viable theory specifically connecting
privacy and personality. Due to the dearth of empirical studies and the
lack of theory, in this study we hence adopt an exploratory perspective.
<!-- In order to guide the selection of personality dimensions that might explain need for privacy best, it is useful to determine why people actually feel they need privacy.  --></p>
<p>In order to understand how personality might relate to privacy, we
can ask the following question: Why do people desire privacy? Privacy is
important. But according to <span class="citation">Trepte and Masur
(2017)</span>, the need for privacy is only a secondary need—not an end
in itself. Accordingly, privacy satisfies other more fundamental needs
such as safety, sexuality, recovery, or contemplation. <span
class="citation">Westin (1967)</span> similarly defined four ultimate
purposes of privacy: (1) self-development (i.e., the integration of
experiences into meaningful patterns), (2) autonomy (the desire to avoid
being manipulated and dominated), (3) emotional release (the release of
tension from social role demands), and (4) protected communication (the
ability to foster intimate relationships). Privacy facilitates
self-disclosure <span class="citation">(Dienlin 2014)</span>, and
thereby social support, relationships, and intimacy <span
class="citation">(Omarzu 2000)</span>. But privacy can also have
negative aspects. It is possible to have too much privacy. Being cut-off
from others can diminish flourishing, nurture deviant behavior, or
introduce power asymmetries <span class="citation">(Altman 1975)</span>.
<!-- The fact that privacy fosters self-disclosure also presents a potential risk, because others might disagree, disapprove, or misuse the information [@petronioCommunicationPrivacyManagement2010].  -->
And privacy can also help conceal wrongdoing or crime.</p>
<!-- To understand why people desire privacy, we can also adopt an evolutionary perspective. -->
<p>Privacy also has strong evolutionary roots <span
class="citation">(Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Hancock 2022)</span>.
Confronted with a threat—for example, the prototypical a tiger—people
are inclined to withdraw. In the presences of opportunities—for example,
the unexpected sharing of resources—people open up and approach one
another. Transferred to privacy, we could imagine that if other people,
the government, or companies are considered a threat, people are more
likely to withdraw and to desire more privacy. Conversely, if something
is considered a resource, people might open up, approach others, and
desire less privacy <span class="citation">(Altman 1976)</span>. Privacy
also affords the opportunity to hide less socially desirable aspects of
the self from others, which may bestow evolutionary advantages in terms
of sexual selection or other social benefits and opportunities. Indeed,
the need for privacy may have evolved precisely because it offers such
advantages.</p>
<p>In what follows, we briefly present each HEXACO factor and how it
might relate to need for privacy.</p>
<div id="honesty-humility-altriusm" class="section level3">
<h3>Honesty-Humility &amp; Altriusm</h3>
<p>Honesty-humility consists of the facets sincerity, fairness, greed
avoidance, and modesty. The meta-facet altruism measures benevolence
toward others and consists of items such as “It wouldn’t bother me to
harm someone I didn’t like” (reversed).<br />
According to the nothing-to-hide argument, a person desiring more
privacy might be less honest, sincere, fair, or benevolent. People who
commit crimes likely face greater risk from some types of
self-disclosure because government agencies and people would enforce
sanctions if their activities were revealed <span
class="citation">(Petronio 2010)</span>. In those cases, the government
and other people may be perceived as a threat. As a consequence, people
with lower honesty and sincerity might desire more privacy as a means to
mitigate their felt risk <span class="citation">(Altman
1976)</span>.</p>
<p>Empirical studies have linked privacy to increased cheating behaviors
<span class="citation">(Corcoran and Rotter 1987; Covey, Saladin, and
Killen 1989)</span>. <span class="citation">Covey, Saladin, and Killen
(1989)</span> asked students to solve an impossible maze. In the
surveillance condition, the experimenter stood in front of the students
and closely monitored their behavior. In the privacy condition, the
experimenter could not see the students. Results showed greater cheating
among students in the privacy condition, suggesting that in situations
with more privacy people are less honest. While this shows a connection
between privacy and dishonesty, other studies more directly support the
notion that a desire for privacy is related to increased dishonesty. In
a longitudinal sample with 457 respondents in Germany <span
class="citation">(Trepte, Dienlin, and Reinecke 2013)</span>, people who
felt they needed more privacy were also less authentic (and therefore,
arguably, also less honest and sincere) on their online social network
profiles (<em>r</em> = -.48). People who needed more privacy were also
less authentic in their personal relationships (<em>r</em> = -.28).
<!-- Together, these studies suggest the possibility that lack of honesty may relate to an increased need for privacy, especially when it comes to government surveillance.    --></p>
<p>We do not mean to suggest that it is only dishonest people who feel a
need for privacy. Everyone, including law-abiding citizens, have
legitimate reasons to hide specific aspects of their lives <span
class="citation">(Solove 2007)</span>. A recent study confirmed this
notion, finding that also those people who explicitly endorsed the
statement that they would have nothing to hide still engaged in several
privacy protective behaviors <span class="citation">(Colnago, Cranor,
and Acquisti 2023)</span>. Our argument is rather that people lower on
the honesty HEXACO factor may feel a greater need for privacy.
Considering all the evidence, it seems more plausible to us that lack of
honesty may indeed relate to an increased need for privacy, and perhaps
especially when it comes to privacy from authorities such as government
agencies.
<!-- , as governments have the legitimate power to prosecute illegal activities.  -->
<!-- Next, it seems plausible that lack of integrity may relate to an increased need for anonymity, as anonymity makes it more difficult for both government and social agents to identify and address potential wrongdoers.  -->
<!-- Finally, lack of integrity may also relate to an increased need for privacy from other people, as most other people will disapprove of immoral or illegal activities, and could even reveal those activities to authorities. --></p>
</div>
<div id="emotionality" class="section level3">
<h3>Emotionality</h3>
<!-- Need for privacy might relate to a person’s level of emotionality.  -->
<p>Emotionality is captured by the facets fearfulness, anxiety,
dependence, and sentimentality. People who are anxious may be more
likely to view social interactions as risky or threatening <span
class="citation">(especially with strangers or weak ties, Granovetter
1973)</span>. Anxious people might hence desire more privacy. People who
are more concerned about their privacy (in other words, more anxious
about privacy) may be more likely to self-withdraw online, for example
by deleting posts or untagging themselves from linked content to
minimize risk <span class="citation">(Dienlin and Metzger 2016)</span>.
On the other hand, the opposite may also be true: People who are more
anxious in general may desire less privacy from others (especially their
strong ties), as a means to cope better with their daily challenges or
to seek social approval to either verify or dispel their social
anxiety.</p>
<p>People who are more anxious might also desire less privacy from
government surveillance. Despite the fact that only 18% of all Americans
trust their government “to do what is right,” almost everyone agrees
that “it’s the government’s job to keep the country safe” <span
class="citation">(Pew Research Center 2017, 2015)</span>. More anxious
people might hence consider the government a resource rather than a
threat. They might more likely consent to government surveillance, given
that such surveillance could prevent crime or terrorism. On the other
hand, it could also be that more anxious people desire more privacy from
government agencies, at least on a personal level. For example, while
they might favor government surveillance of <em>others</em>, this does
not necessarily include <em>themselves</em>. Especially if the
government is perceived as a threat, as often expressed by members of
minority groups, then anxiety might lead one to actually desire more
personal privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="extraversion" class="section level3">
<h3>Extraversion</h3>
<p>Comprising the facets social self-esteem, social boldness,
sociability, and liveliness, extraversion is arguably the factor that
should correspond most closely to need for privacy.
<!-- This especially pertains to the sociability facet, which captures whether people prefer to spend their time alone or with company.  -->
<!-- It is plausible that  --> Conceptually, social privacy and
sociability are closely related. More sociable people are likely more
inclined to think of other people as a resource, and thus they should
desire less horizontal privacy and less anonymity <span
class="citation">(e.g., Buss 2001)</span>. Given that privacy is a
voluntary withdrawal from society <span class="citation">(Westin
1967)</span>, people who are less sociable, more reserved, or more shy
should have a greater need for privacy from others.</p>
<p>This assumption is supported by several empirical studies. People who
scored higher on the personality meta-factor plasticity, which is a
composite of the two personality factors extraversion and openness, were
found to desire less privacy <span class="citation">(Morton
2013)</span>. People who described themselves as introverted thinkers
were more likely to prefer social isolation <span
class="citation">(Pedersen 1982)</span>. Introverted people were more
likely to feel their privacy was invaded when they were asked to answer
very personal questions <span class="citation">(Stone 1986)</span>.
<span class="citation">Pedersen (1982)</span> reported that the need for
privacy related to general self-esteem (but not social self-esteem),
which in turn is a defining part of extraversion <span
class="citation">(Lee and Ashton 2018)</span>. Specifically, he found
respondents who held a lower general self-esteem were more reserved
(<em>r</em> = .29), and needed more anonymity (<em>r</em> = .21) and
solitude (<em>r</em> = .24). Finally, <span class="citation">Larson and
Bell (1988)</span> and <span class="citation">Hosman (1991)</span>
suggested that people who are more shy also need more privacy.</p>
<p>As a result, we expect that people who are more extraverted also need
less social privacy and less privacy in general. Regarding the other
dimensions of privacy, such as privacy from governments or from
companies, we do not expect specific effects.</p>
</div>
<div id="agreeableness" class="section level3">
<h3>Agreeableness</h3>
<p>Agreeableness has the four facets of forgiveness, gentleness,
flexibility, and patience. It is not entirely clear whether or how
agreeableness might relate to the need for privacy, although people who
are more agreeable are also moderately less concerned about their
privacy <span class="citation">(Junglas, Johnson, and Spitzmüller
2008)</span>. Thus, because need for privacy and privacy concern are
closely related, more agreeable people might desire less privacy. To
explain, more agreeable people might hold more generous attitudes toward
others and are less suspicious that others have malicious motives, and
consequently perceive less risk from interacting with others.</p>
</div>
<div id="conscientiousness" class="section level3">
<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>
<p>Conscientiousness consists of the facets organization, diligence,
perfectionism, and prudence. Arguably, all facets are about being in
control, about reducing relevant risks and future costs. Because control
is a central part of privacy <span class="citation">(Westin
1967)</span>, people who avoid risks, who deliberate, and who plan ahead
carefully, might prefer to have more privacy because it affords them
greater control. Especially if others are considered a threat, being
risk averse might increase the desire for more horizontal privacy.
Similarly, if government agencies or private companies are considered a
threat, risk averse people might have a stronger desire for vertical
privacy. In either case, the most cautious strategy to minimize risks of
information disclosure would be to keep as much information as possible
private. Empirical studies have found that people with a stronger
control motive require slightly more seclusion (<em>r</em> = .12) and
anonymity (<em>r</em> = .15) <span class="citation">(Hosman
1991)</span>. People who considered their privacy at risk are less
likely to disclose information online <span class="citation">(e.g., Bol
et al. 2018)</span>. Moreover, conscientious people are more concerned
about their privacy <span class="citation">(Junglas, Johnson, and
Spitzmüller 2008)</span>.
<!-- But as discussed above, especially with regard to privacy from government surveillance, risk averse people could also desire _less_ privacy, so that the government is able to avert potential threats.  -->
<!-- In sum, think that it is most plausible that people who are more risk averse also desire more privacy in all three contexts measured in this study. --></p>
</div>
<div id="openness-to-experience" class="section level3">
<h3>Openness to experience</h3>
<p>Openness to experiences comprises the facets aesthetic appreciation,
inquisitiveness, creativeness, and unconventionality. Openness to
experience is also considered a measure of intellect and education. In
one study it was found that more educated people have more knowledge
about how to protect their privacy <span class="citation">(Park
2013)</span>, which could be the result of an increased need for
privacy. Similarly, openness to experience is positively related to
privacy concern <span class="citation">(Junglas, Johnson, and
Spitzmüller 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, openness is conceptually the opposite of privacy.
People more open to new experiences might not prioritize privacy. Many
digital practices such as social media, online shopping, or online
dating offer exciting benefits and new experiences, but pose a risk to
privacy. People who are more open to new experiences might focus on the
benefits rather than the potential risks. Hence, either a positive or
negative relationship between need for privacy and openness is
possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="socio-demographic-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Socio-demographic variables</h3>
<p>The need for privacy should also be related to sociodemographic
aspects, such as sex, age, education, and income. For example, a study
of 3,072 people from Germany found that women desired more informational
and physical privacy than men, whereas men desired more psychological
privacy <span class="citation">(Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte
2023)</span>. In a nationally representative study of the U.S. and
Japan, people who were older and who had higher income reported more
privacy concern. More educated people possess more privacy knowledge
<span class="citation">(Park 2013)</span>, and as a consequence they
might desire more privacy. Ethnicity might also correspond to the need
for privacy, perhaps because members of minority groups desire more
privacy from the government, although not necessarily from other people.
Some minorities groups (e.g., Black or Native Americans) often report
lower levels of trust in white government representatives <span
class="citation">(Koch 2019)</span>, which might increase the desire of
privacy from government agencies. Last, we will examine whether one’s
political position is related to the need for privacy. We could imagine
that more right-leaning people desire more privacy from the government,
but not necessarily from other people. People who are more conservative
tend to trust the government slightly less <span class="citation">(Cook
and Gronke 2005)</span>, which might be associated with an increased
need for privacy. We will also explore whether a person’s romantic
relationship status corresponds to their expressed need for privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-of-expectations" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview of expectations</h3>
<p>The arguments discussed above lead to a number of expectations for
our data which we delineate below, in order from most to least
confidence in terms of identifying significant effects. First, we
strongly assume that more extraverted people will desire less privacy,
especially less social privacy. We also expect that people who are less
honest will express greater need for privacy. We further assume that
more conscientious people will desire more privacy and that more
agreeable people may desire less privacy. Yet it is largely unclear how
privacy needs relate to openness to experience and emotionality. In
terms of the sociodemographic variables, we expect females likely need
more informational and physical privacy, while males will likely report
needing more psychological privacy. Older, more highly educated, and
affluent people are also expected to need more privacy, and we
anticipate that people who are ethnic minorities or are politically
conservative will express greater need for privacy from the government
than from other people.</p>

<div id="method" class="section level1">
<h1>Method</h1>
<p>This section describes how we determine the sample size, data
exclusions, the analyses, and all measures in the study. The Study will
be conducted as an online questionnaire, programmed with Qualtrics. A
preview of the survey can be found <a
href="https://compcommlab.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/previewId/5c6193c9-12a4-424f-9808-a7c6e74247c1/SV_9ppRmr32VrmeAnA?Q_CHL=preview&amp;Q_SurveyVersionID=current">here</a>.</p>
<div id="prestudy" class="section level2">
<h2>Prestudy</h2>
<p>This study builds on a prior project in which we analyzed the same
research question <span class="citation">(Dienlin and Metzger
2019)</span>. This study was already submitted to Collabra, but
rejected. The main reasons were that the sample was too small, that not
one coherent personality inventory was used, that most privacy measures
were designed ad-hoc, and that the inferences were too ambitious. We
hence decided to treat our prior project as a pilot study and to address
the criticism by conducting a new study. In this new study, we redevelop
our study design, we collect a larger sample, implement the HEXACO
inventory together with established need for privacy measures, and
overall adopt a more exploratory perspective. Being our central
construct of interest, we also develop a small number of new items to
have a more comprehensive measure of need for privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="sample" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample</h2>
<p>Participants will be collected from the professional online survey
panel Prolific. The sample will be representative of the US in terms of
age, gender, and ethnicity. The study received IRB approval from the
University of Vienna (#20210805_067). We calculated that participation
will take approximately 15 minutes. We will pay participants $2.00 for
participation, which equals an hourly wage of $8.00.</p>
<p>To determine sample size, we ran a priori power analyses using the R
package <em>simsem</em> <span class="citation">(Pornprasertmanit et al.
2021)</span>. We based our power analysis on a smallest effect size of
interest (SESOI; see also below). We only considered effects at least as
great as <em>r</em> = .10 as sufficiently relevant to support an
effect’s existence <span class="citation">(Cohen 1992)</span>.
<!-- Note that the final analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM), for which exact power analyses are difficult to obtain.  -->
<!-- We therefore conducted preliminary power analyses using two-sided bivariate correlations.  -->
To estimate power, we simulated data.” We set the correlation between
two exemplary latent factors of personality and privacy variable to be
<span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> = .10. We, furthermore, set
the latent factor loadings to be <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = .85 (the SESOI)
<!-- Hence, the following power analyses are not exact but rather a rough guide to get a better idea of the required minimum sample size. -->
<!-- Oftentimes, researchers opt for an alpha error of 5% and a power of 80% (i.e., beta error of 20%). -->
Adopting an exploratory perspective, and not wanting to miss actually
existing effects, we considered both alpha and beta errors to be equally
relevant, resulting in balanced/identical alpha and beta errors <span
class="citation">(Rouder et al. 2016)</span>. Because balanced alpha and
beta errors of 5% are outside of our budget, we opted for balanced alpha
and beta errors of 10%. A power analysis with an alpha and beta error of
10% and an effect size of <em>r</em> = .10 revealed that we required a
sample size of <em>N</em> = 1501. To account for potential attrition
(see below), we will oversample by five percent, leading to a final
sample size of N = 1576. We obtained sufficient funding to collect a
sample of this size.
<!-- Hence, we will use two inference criteria: Effects need to show a _p_-value of below _p_ = 10% and an effect size of at least _r_ = .10.  --></p>
</div>
<div id="exclusions-and-imputation" class="section level2">
<h2>Exclusions and Imputation</h2>
<p>We will individually check answers for response patterns such as
straight-lining or missing of inverted items. We will conservatively
remove participants with clear response patterns. We will automatically
exclude participants who miss the two attention checks we will
implement. Participants who miss one attention check will be checked
individually regarding response patterns. We will remove participants
below the minimum participation age of 18 years. We will remove
respondents with unrealistically fast responses (three standard
deviations below the median response time).
<!-- We will exclude respondents if they answer fewer than 50% of all questions.  --></p>
<p>Missing responses will be imputed using multiple imputation with
predictive mean matching (ten datasets, five iterations, using variables
that correlate at least with <em>r</em> = .10). The analyses will be run
with all ten datasets, and the pooled results will be reported.</p>
</div>
<div id="planned-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Planned Analyses</h2>
<!-- We will test items for potential ceiling and floor effects.  -->
<!-- If means are below 1.5 or above 6.5, these items will be excluded. -->
<p>The factorial validity of the measures and the relations will be
tested using structural equation modeling. If Mardia’s test shows that
the assumption of multivariate normality is violated, we will use the
more robust Satorra-Bentler scaled and mean-adjusted test statistic
(MLM) as estimator. We will test each scale in a confirmatory factor
analysis. To assess model fit, we will use more liberal fit criteria to
avoid overfitting (CFI &gt; .90, TLI &gt; .90, RMSEA &lt; .10, SRMR &lt;
.10) <span class="citation">(Kline 2016)</span>. In cases of misfit, we
will conservatively alter models using an a priori defined analysis
pipeline (see online supplementary material). As a “reality check,” we
will test items for potential ceiling and floor effects. If means are
below 1.5 or above 6.5, these items will be excluded.</p>
<p>We want to find out <em>who</em> needs privacy, and not so much
<em>what causes</em> the need for privacy. Hence, to answer our research
question, in a joint model combining all variables (including
sociodemographic variables) we will analyze the variables’ bivariate
relations. To predict the need for privacy, we will first use the six
personality factors. Afterward, we will predict privacy using the more
specific facets. To get a first idea of the variables’ potential causal
relations, we will also run a multiple structural regression model.
<!-- We will also test which individual items best predict need for privacy. --></p>
<p>We will use two measures as inference criteria: statistical
significance and effect size. Regarding statistical significance, we
will use an alpha value of 10%. Regarding effect size, we will define a
SESOI of <em>r</em> = .10, and thereby a null-region ranging from -.10
to .10. As proposed by <span class="citation">Dienes (2014)</span>, we
will consider effects to be meaningful if the confidence interval falls
outside of the null region (e.g., .15 to .25 or -.15 to -.25). We will
consider effects irrelevant if the confidence interval falls completely
within the null region (e.g., .02 to .08). And we will suspend judgement
if the confidence intervals partially include the null region (e.g., .05
to .15).</p>
<p>Fully latent SEMs seldom work instantly, often requiring
modifications to achieve satisfactory model fit. Although we explicate
our analysis pipeline, there still remain several researcher degrees of
freedom. We decided to use fully latent SEMs because we consider it
superior to regular analyses such as correlation or regression using
manifest variables <span class="citation">(Kline 2016)</span>. Combining
several items into latent factors helps reduce noise and thereby the
beta error. To provide context, in the online supplementary material
(OSM) we will also share the results of alternative analyses, such as
correlations of average scores.</p>
<p>We anticipate to finish the project three months after our
registration was accepted.</p>
</div>
<div id="measures" class="section level2">
<h2>Measures</h2>
<p>All items will be answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1
(<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 7 (<em>strongly agree</em>).<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A list of
all the items that we will use are reported in the online supplementary

order, and the sociodemographic questions will be asked at the end. We
will later report also the results of the CFAs/EFAs, as well as item
statistics and their distribution plots.</p>
<div id="need-for-privacy" class="section level3">
<h3>Need for privacy</h3>
<p>Although there exist several operationalizations of need for privacy
<span class="citation">(Buss 2001; Pedersen 1979; Frener, Dombrowski,
and Trepte 2023; Marshall 1974)</span>, we are not aware of one
encompassing, comprehensive, and up-to-date scale. Hence, we use both
existing scales and self-developed items, some of which were tested in
our pilot study. Ad-hoc scales were or will be (preliminarily) validated
using the following procedure: We (a) collected qualitative feedback
from three different privacy experts;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (b) followed the procedure implemented by
<span class="citation">Patalay, Hayes, and Wolpert (2018)</span> to test
(and adapt) the items using four established readability indices (i.e.,
Flesch–Kincaid reading grade, Gunning Fog Index, Coleman Liau Index, and
the Dale–Chall Readability Formula); (c) like <span
class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte (2023)</span>, we will
assess convergent validity by collecting single-item measures of privacy
concern and privacy behavior, for which we expect to find small to
moderate correlations; (d) all items will be analyzed in confirmatory
factor analyses as outlined above.</p>
<p>Overall, we will collect 32 items measuring need for privacy, with
eight subdimensions that all consist of four items each. Three
subdimensions capture horizontal privacy—namely <em>psychological</em>,
<em>social</em>, and <em>physical</em> privacy from other individuals.
Psychological and physical privacy were adopted from <span
class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte (2023)</span>. Because
<span class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte (2023)</span>
could not successfully operationalize the dimension of social privacy,
building on <span class="citation">Burgoon (1982)</span> we
self-designed a new social privacy dimension, which in the prestudy
showed satisfactory fit. Two subdimensions measure vertical privacy. The
first subdimension is <em>government surveillance</em>, which represents
the extent to which people want the government to abstain from
collecting information about them. The scale was pretested and showed
good factorial validity. The second subdimension is need for privacy
from <em>companies</em>, which we will measure using four new
self-designed items. Finally, three subdimensions capture general
privacy. The first subdimension is <em>informational</em> privacy, with
items adopted from <span class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte
(2023)</span>. The second subdimension is <em>anonymity</em>, which
captures the extent to which people feel the need to avoid
identification in general. The scale was pretested and showed good
factorial validity; one new item was designed for this study. Third, we
will also collect a new self-developed measure of <em>general</em> need
for privacy.</p>
