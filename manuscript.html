<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
Privacy is defined as a voluntary withdrawal from society. While
everyone needs some degree of privacy, we currently know little about
who needs how much. In this study, we explored the relations between the
need for privacy and personality. Personality was operationalized using
the HEXACO personality inventory. Need for privacy was measured in
relation to social, psychological, and physical privacy from other
individuals (horizontal privacy); need for privacy from government
agencies and companies (vertical privacy); as well as need for
informational privacy, anonymity, and general privacy (both horizontal
and vertical privacy). A sample of 1,550 respondents representative of
the U.S. in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity was collected. The
results showed several substantial relationships: More extraverted and
more agreeable people needed substantially less privacy. People less
fair and less altruistic needed more psychological privacy, social
privacy, and anonymity, lending some support to the ‘nothing to
hide-argument’. Emotionality and conscientiousness showed varied
relations with need for privacy. More conservative respondents needed
more privacy from the government.

<p>Privacy is a major topic of public discourse and academic interest
<span class="citation">(Dienlin and Breuer 2023)</span>. Yet despite its
importance, to date we still know surprisingly little about the relation
between privacy and personality <span class="citation">(Masur 2018,
155)</span>. What can we infer about a person if they desire more
privacy? Are they more introverted, more risk-averse, or more
traditional? Asking these questions seems relevant, not least because
people who desire more privacy are often regarded with suspicion, having
to justify why they want to be left alone. Consider the
“nothing-to-hide” argument <span class="citation">(Solove 2007)</span>,
which is that people who oppose state surveillance only do so because
they have something to hide—because if you have nothing to hide, you
would have nothing to fear. Is it true that people who desire more
privacy are also more dishonest, greedy, or unfair? Or are people simply
less extraverted, more diligent, or more prudent? With this paper, we
seek to answer the following question: What can we learn about a
person’s personality if they say they desire more privacy?</p>
<div id="privacy-and-personality" class="section level2">
<h2>Privacy and Personality</h2>
<p>Privacy captures a <em>withdrawal</em> from others or from society in
general <span class="citation">(Westin 1967)</span>. This withdrawal
happens <em>voluntarily</em>, and it is under a person’s
<em>control</em> <span class="citation">(Westin 1967)</span>. Privacy is
also multi-dimensional. On the broadest level, we can differentiate the
two dimensions of horizontal and vertical privacy <span
class="citation">(Schwartz 1968; Masur, Teutsch, and Dienlin
2018)</span>. Whereas horizontal privacy captures withdrawal from other
people or peers, vertical privacy addresses withdrawal from superiors or
institutions (e.g., government agencies or businesses). In her
theoretical analysis, <span class="citation">Burgoon (1982)</span>
argued that privacy has four more specific dimensions: informational,
social, psychological, and physical privacy. <span
class="citation">Pedersen (1979)</span> conducted an empirical factor
analysis of 94 privacy-related items, finding six dimensions of privacy:
reserve (“unwillingness to be with and talk with others, especially
strangers,” p. 1293); isolation (“desire to be alone and away from
others,” p. 1293), solitude (“being alone by oneself and free from
observation by others,” p. 1293), intimacy with friends (“being alone
with friends,” p. 1293), intimacy with family (“being alone with members
of one’s own family,” p. 1293), and anonymity (“wanting to go unnoticed
in a crowd and not wishing to be the center of group attention,”
p. 1293). Building on these understandings of privacy, in this study we
employ a multifaceted model of need for privacy. We focus on
<em>vertical</em> privacy with regard to people’s felt need for
withdrawal from surveillance by a) the government and b) private
companies; <em>horizontal</em> privacy in terms of the perceived need
for (c) psychological, (d) social and/or (e) physical withdrawal from
other people; and <em>general</em> privacy as captured by people’s felt
need for (f) informational privacy, (g) anonymity, and (h) privacy in
general. Although all of these dimensions were defined and established
in prior research, combining these dimensions into one single
comprehensive measure of privacy represents a novel approach.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that various understandings of personality exist, we
operationalize personality using the factors and facets of the HEXACO
inventory of personality <span class="citation">(Lee and Ashton
2018)</span>. HEXACO is a large and comprehensive operationalization of
personality, and thus is less likely to miss potentially relevant
aspects than other operationalizations. The HEXACO model stands in the
tradition of the Big Five approach <span class="citation">(John and
Srivastava 1999)</span>. It includes six factors (discussed below),
which have four specific facets each. In addition, the HEXACO model
includes a sixth factor not present in the Big Five labeled
honesty-humility, plus a meta-facet called altruism, which seem
particularly well-suited to investigate the
nothing-to-hide-argument.</p>
<p>In predicting the need for privacy, we will primarily focus on the
facets, because it is unlikely that the very specific need for privacy
dimensions will relate closely to more general personality factors <span
class="citation">(Bansal, Zahedi, and Gefen 2010; Junglas, Johnson, and
Spitzmüller 2008)</span>. And for reasons of scope, below we cannot
discuss all four facets for all six factors. Instead, we focus on those
we consider most relevant. However, all will be analyzed
empirically.</p>
</div>
<div id="predicting-the-need-for-privacy" class="section level2">
<h2>Predicting the Need for Privacy</h2>
<p>So far, only a few studies have analyzed the relation between
personality and need for privacy empirically <span
class="citation">(Hosman 1991; Pedersen 1982, see below)</span>.
Moreover, we are not aware of a viable theory specifically connecting
privacy and personality. Due to the dearth of empirical studies and the
lack of theory, in this study we hence adopt an exploratory
perspective.</p>
<p>In order to understand how personality might relate to privacy, we
can ask the following question: Why do people desire privacy? Privacy is
important. But according to <span class="citation">Trepte and Masur
(2017)</span>, the need for privacy is only a secondary need—not an end
in itself. Accordingly, privacy satisfies other more fundamental needs
such as safety, sexuality, recovery, or contemplation. <span
class="citation">Westin (1967)</span> similarly defined four ultimate
purposes of privacy: (1) self-development (the integration of
experiences into meaningful patterns), (2) autonomy (the desire to avoid
being manipulated and dominated), (3) emotional release (the release of
tension from social role demands), and (4) protected communication (the
ability to foster intimate relationships). Privacy facilitates
self-disclosure <span class="citation">(Dienlin 2014)</span>, and
thereby social support, relationships, and intimacy <span
class="citation">(Omarzu 2000)</span>. But privacy can also have
negative aspects. It is possible to have too much privacy. Being cut-off
from others can diminish flourishing, nurture deviant behavior, or
introduce power asymmetries <span class="citation">(Altman 1975)</span>.
And privacy can also help conceal wrongdoing or crime.</p>
<p>Privacy has strong evolutionary roots <span
class="citation">(Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Hancock 2022)</span>.
Confronted with a threat—for example, the prototypical tiger—people are
inclined to withdraw. In the presences of opportunities—for example, the
unexpected sharing of resources—people open up and approach one another.
Transferred to privacy, we could imagine that if other people, the
government, or companies are considered a threat, people are more likely
to withdraw and to desire more privacy. Conversely, if something is
considered a resource, people might open up, approach others, and desire
less privacy <span class="citation">(Altman 1976)</span>. Privacy also
affords the opportunity to hide less socially desirable aspects of the
self from others, which may bestow evolutionary advantages in terms of
sexual selection or other social benefits and opportunities. Indeed, the
need for privacy may have evolved precisely because it offers such
advantages.</p>
<p>In what follows, we briefly present each HEXACO factor and how it
might relate to need for privacy.</p>
<div id="honesty-humility-altriusm" class="section level3">
<h3>Honesty-Humility &amp; Altriusm</h3>
<p>Honesty-humility consists of the facets sincerity, fairness, greed
avoidance, and modesty. The meta-facet altruism measures benevolence
toward others and consists of items such as “It wouldn’t bother me to
harm someone I didn’t like” (reversed).<br />
According to the nothing-to-hide argument, a person desiring more
privacy might be less honest, sincere, fair, or benevolent. People who
commit crimes likely face greater risk from some types of
self-disclosure because government agencies and people would enforce
sanctions if their activities were revealed <span
class="citation">(Petronio 2010)</span>. In those cases, the government
and other people may be perceived as a threat. As a consequence, people
with lower honesty and sincerity might desire more privacy as a means to
mitigate their felt risk <span class="citation">(Altman
1976)</span>.</p>
<p>Empirical studies have linked privacy to increased cheating behaviors
<span class="citation">(Corcoran and Rotter 1987; Covey, Saladin, and
Killen 1989)</span>. <span class="citation">Covey, Saladin, and Killen
(1989)</span> asked students to solve an impossible maze. In the
surveillance condition, the experimenter stood in front of the students
and closely monitored their behavior. In the privacy condition, the
experimenter could not see the students. Results showed greater cheating
among students in the privacy condition, suggesting that in situations
with more privacy people are less honest. In a longitudinal sample with
457 respondents in Germany <span class="citation">(Trepte, Dienlin, and
Reinecke 2013)</span>, people who felt they needed more privacy were
also less authentic (and therefore, arguably, also less honest and
sincere) on their online social network profiles (<em>r</em> = -.48).
People who needed more privacy were also less authentic in their
personal relationships (<em>r</em> = -.28).</p>
<p>We do not mean to suggest that it is only dishonest people who feel a
need for privacy. Everyone, including law-abiding citizens, have
legitimate reasons to hide specific aspects of their lives <span
class="citation">(Solove 2007)</span>. A recent study confirmed this
notion, finding that people who explicitly endorsed the statement that
they would have nothing to hide still engaged in several privacy
protective behaviors <span class="citation">(Colnago, Cranor, and
Acquisti 2023)</span>. Our argument is rather that people lower on the
honesty HEXACO factor may feel a greater need for privacy. Considering
all the evidence, it seems more plausible to us that lack of honesty may
indeed relate to an increased need for privacy, and perhaps especially
when it comes to privacy from authorities such as government
agencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="emotionality" class="section level3">
<h3>Emotionality</h3>
<p>Emotionality is captured by the facets of fearfulness, anxiety,
dependence, and sentimentality. People who are anxious may be more
likely to view social interactions as risky or threatening <span
class="citation">(especially with strangers or weak ties, Granovetter
1973)</span>. Anxious people might hence desire more privacy. People who
are more concerned about their privacy (in other words, more anxious
about privacy) are more likely to self-withdraw online, for example by
deleting posts or untagging themselves from linked content to minimize
risk <span class="citation">(Dienlin and Metzger 2016)</span>. On the
other hand, the opposite may also be true: People who are more anxious
in general may desire less privacy from others (especially their strong
ties), as a means to cope better with their daily challenges or to seek
social approval to either verify or dispel their social anxiety.</p>
<p>People who are more anxious might also desire less privacy from
government surveillance. Despite the fact that only 18% of all Americans
trust their government “to do what is right,” almost everyone agrees
that “it’s the government’s job to keep the country safe” <span
class="citation">(Pew Research Center 2017, 2015)</span>. More anxious
people might hence consider the government a resource rather than a
threat. They might more likely consent to government surveillance, given
that such surveillance could prevent crime or terrorism. On the other
hand, it could also be that more anxious people desire more privacy from
government agencies, at least on a personal level. For example, while
they might favor government surveillance of <em>others</em>, this does
not necessarily include <em>themselves</em>. Especially if the
government is perceived as a threat, as often expressed by members of
minority groups, then anxiety might lead one to actually desire more
personal privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="extraversion" class="section level3">
<h3>Extraversion</h3>
<p>Comprising the facets social self-esteem, social boldness,
sociability, and liveliness, extraversion is arguably the factor that
should correspond most closely to need for privacy. Conceptually, social
privacy and sociability are closely related. More sociable people are
likely more inclined to think of other people as a resource, and thus
they should desire less horizontal privacy and less anonymity <span
class="citation">(e.g., Buss 2001)</span>. Given that privacy is a
voluntary withdrawal from society <span class="citation">(Westin
1967)</span>, people who are less sociable, more reserved, or more shy
should have a greater need for privacy from others.</p>
<p>This assumption is supported by several empirical studies. People who
scored higher on the personality meta-factor plasticity, which is a
composite of the two personality factors extraversion and openness, were
found to desire less privacy <span class="citation">(Morton
2013)</span>. People who described themselves as introverted thinkers
were more likely to prefer social isolation <span
class="citation">(Pedersen 1982)</span>. Introverted people were more
likely to feel their privacy was invaded when they were asked to answer
very personal questions <span class="citation">(Stone 1986)</span>.
<span class="citation">Pedersen (1982)</span> reported that the need for
privacy related to general self-esteem (but not social self-esteem),
which in turn is a defining part of extraversion <span
class="citation">(Lee and Ashton 2018)</span>. Specifically, he found
respondents who held a lower general self-esteem were more reserved
(<em>r</em> = .29), and needed more anonymity (<em>r</em> = .21) and
solitude (<em>r</em> = .24). Finally, <span class="citation">Larson and
Bell (1988)</span> and <span class="citation">Hosman (1991)</span>
suggested that people who are more shy also need more privacy.</p>
<p>As a result, we expect that people who are more extraverted also need
less social privacy and less privacy in general. Regarding the other
dimensions of privacy, such as privacy from governments or from
companies, we do not expect specific effects.</p>
</div>
<div id="agreeableness" class="section level3">
<h3>Agreeableness</h3>
<p>Agreeableness has the four facets of forgiveness, gentleness,
flexibility, and patience. It is not entirely clear whether or how
agreeableness might relate to the need for privacy, although people who
are more agreeable are also moderately less concerned about their
privacy <span class="citation">(Junglas, Johnson, and Spitzmüller
2008)</span>. Thus, because need for privacy and privacy concern are
closely related, more agreeable people might desire less privacy. To
explain, more agreeable people might hold more generous attitudes toward
others and are less suspicious that others have malicious motives, and
consequently perceive less risk from interacting with others.</p>
</div>
<div id="conscientiousness" class="section level3">
<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>
<p>Conscientiousness consists of the facets organization, diligence,
perfectionism, and prudence. Arguably, all facets are about being in
control, about reducing relevant risks and future costs. Because control
is a central part of privacy <span class="citation">(Westin
1967)</span>, people who avoid risks, who deliberate, and who plan ahead
carefully might prefer to have more privacy because it affords them
greater control. Especially if others are considered a threat, being
risk averse might increase the desire for more horizontal privacy.
Similarly, if government agencies or private companies are considered a
threat, risk averse people might have a stronger desire for vertical
privacy. In either case, the most cautious strategy to minimize risks of
information disclosure would be to keep as much information as possible
private. Empirical studies have found that people with a stronger
control motive require slightly more seclusion (<em>r</em> = .12) and
anonymity (<em>r</em> = .15) <span class="citation">(Hosman
1991)</span>. People who considered their privacy at risk are less
likely to disclose information online <span class="citation">(e.g., Bol
et al. 2018)</span>. Moreover, conscientious people are more concerned
about their privacy <span class="citation">(Junglas, Johnson, and
Spitzmüller 2008)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="openness-to-experience" class="section level3">
<h3>Openness to experience</h3>
<p>Openness to experiences comprises the facets aesthetic appreciation,
inquisitiveness, creativeness, and unconventionality. Openness to
experience is also considered a measure of intellect and education. In
one study it was found that more educated people have more knowledge
about how to protect their privacy <span class="citation">(Park
2013)</span>, which could be the result of an increased need for
privacy. Similarly, openness to experience is positively related to
privacy concern <span class="citation">(Junglas, Johnson, and
Spitzmüller 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, openness is conceptually the opposite of privacy.
People more open to new experiences might not prioritize privacy. Many
digital practices such as social media, online shopping, or online
dating offer exciting benefits and new experiences, but pose a risk to
privacy. People who are more open to new experiences might focus on the
benefits rather than the potential risks. Hence, either a positive or
negative relationship between need for privacy and openness is
possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="sociodemographic-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Sociodemographic variables</h3>
<p>The need for privacy should also be related to sociodemographic
aspects, such as sex, age, education, and income. For example, a study
of 3,072 people from Germany found that women desired more informational
and physical privacy than men, whereas men desired more psychological
privacy <span class="citation">(Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte
2023)</span>. In a nationally representative study of the U.S. and
Japan, people who were older and who had higher income reported more
privacy concern. More educated people possess more privacy knowledge
<span class="citation">(Park 2013)</span>, and as a consequence they
might desire more privacy. Ethnicity might also correspond to the need
for privacy, perhaps because members of minority groups desire more
privacy from the government, although not necessarily from other people.
Some minority groups (e.g., Black or Native Americans) often report
lower levels of trust in white government representatives <span
class="citation">(Koch 2019)</span>, which might increase the desire of
privacy from government agencies. Last, we will examine whether one’s
political position is related to the need for privacy. We could imagine
that more right-leaning people desire more privacy from the government,
but not necessarily from other people. People who are more conservative
tend to trust the government slightly less <span class="citation">(Cook
and Gronke 2005)</span>, which might be associated with an increased
need for privacy. We will also explore whether a person’s romantic
relationship status corresponds to their expressed need for privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-of-expectations" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview of expectations</h3>
<p>The arguments discussed above lead to a number of expectations for
our data which we delineate below, in order from most to least
confidence in terms of identifying significant effects. First, we
strongly assume that more extraverted people will desire less privacy,
especially less social privacy. We also expect that people who are less
honest will express greater need for privacy. We further assume that
more conscientious people will desire more privacy and that more
agreeable people may desire less privacy. Yet it is largely unclear how
privacy needs relate to openness to experience and emotionality. In
terms of the sociodemographic variables, we expect females likely need
more informational and physical privacy, while males will likely report
needing more psychological privacy. Older, more highly educated, and
affluent people are also expected to need more privacy, and we
anticipate that people who are ethnic minorities or are politically
conservative will express greater need for privacy from the government
than from other people.</p>

<div id="method" class="section level1">
<h1>Method</h1>
<p>This section describes how we determined the sample size, data
exclusions, the analyses, and all measures in the study. The study was
conducted as an online questionnaire, programmed with Qualtrics. The
survey can be found in the <a
href="https://osf.io/e47yw/files/osfstorage/65c363e69b32ca0b4397f002">online
supplementary material</a>.</p>
<div id="prestudy" class="section level2">
<h2>Prestudy</h2>
<p>This study builds on a prior project in which we analyzed the same
research question <span class="citation">(Dienlin and Metzger
2019)</span>. This study was already submitted to Collabra but rejected.
The main reasons were that the sample was too small, that not one
coherent personality inventory was used, that most privacy measures were
designed ad-hoc, and that the inferences were too ambitious. We hence
decided to treat our prior project as a pilot study and to address the
criticism by conducting a new study. In this new study, we redeveloped
our study design, collected a larger sample, implemented the HEXACO
inventory together with established need for privacy measures, and
overall adopted a more exploratory perspective. Being our central
construct of interest, we also developed a small number of new items to
have a more comprehensive measure of need for privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="sample" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample</h2>
<p>Participants were collected from the professional online survey panel
Prolific. The sample was representative of the US in terms of age,
gender, and ethnicity. The study received IRB approval from the
University of Vienna (#20210805_067). Participation took on average 16
minutes. We paid participants $2.00 for participation, which equals an
hourly wage of $8.00.</p>
<p>To determine sample size, we ran a priori power analyses using the R
package <em>simsem</em> <span class="citation">(Pornprasertmanit et al.
2021)</span>. We based our power analysis on a smallest effect size of
interest (SESOI; see below). We only considered effects at least as
great as <em>r</em> = .10 as sufficiently relevant to support an
effect’s existence <span class="citation">(Cohen 1992)</span>. To
estimate power, we simulated data. We set the correlation between two
exemplary latent factors of personality and privacy variable to be <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> = .10 (the SESOI). We furthermore
set the latent factor loadings to be <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = .85. Adopting an exploratory
perspective, and not wanting to miss actually existing effects, we
considered both alpha and beta errors to be equally relevant, resulting
in balanced/identical alpha and beta errors <span
class="citation">(Rouder et al. 2016)</span>. Because balanced alpha and
beta errors of 5% were outside of our budget, we opted for balanced
alpha and beta errors of 10%. A power analysis with an alpha and beta
error of 10% and an effect size of <em>r</em> = .10 revealed that we
required a sample size of <em>N</em> = 1501. To account for potential
attrition (see below), we over-sampled by five percent, leading to a
planned sample size of <em>N</em> = 1576. In the end, 1569 respondents
finished our study, of which we could use 1550, which slightly exceeds
our required sample size.</p>
</div>
<div id="exclusions-and-imputation" class="section level2">
<h2>Exclusions and Imputation</h2>
<p>We individually checked answers for response patterns such as
straight-lining or missing of inverted items. We planned to
conservatively remove participants with clear response patterns. Nine
participants were excluded because they showed clear patterns, such as
straight-lining. We automatically excluded participants who missed the
two attention checks we implemented. Overall, 30 participants were
filtered out automatically by Prolific, not counting toward our quota.
Participants who missed one attention check were checked individually
regarding response patterns. No clear patterns emerged. We planned to
remove participants below the minimum participation age of 18 years. As
no minors took part in our study we did not exclude any participant for
this reason. We planned to remove respondents with unrealistically fast
responses (three standard deviations below the median response time).
The median response time was 14 minutes and the standard deviation 11
minutes. Hence, three SDs below median was -19 minutes, hence not
informative. Instead, we decided to remove respondents who took less
than five minutes answering the questionnaire, which we considered
unreasonably fast. We removed 10 participants for this reason.</p>
<p>We planned to impute missing responses using multiple imputation with
predictive mean matching (ten data-sets, five iterations, using
variables that correlate at least with <em>r</em> = .10). However, as
there were only 27 answers missing in total (0.007 percent), we decided
not to impute any data. The final sample size was <em>N</em> = 1550.</p>
</div>
<div id="analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Analyses</h2>
<p>The factorial validity of the measures and the relations were tested
using structural equation modeling. If Mardia’s test showed that the
assumption of multivariate normality was violated, we used the more
robust Satorra-Bentler scaled and mean-adjusted test statistic (MLM) as
estimator (or, in the few cases of missing data MLR plus FIML
estimation). We tested each scale in a confirmatory factor analysis. To
assess model fit, we used more liberal fit criteria to avoid
over-fitting (CFI &gt; .90, TLI &gt; .90, RMSEA &lt; .10, SRMR &lt; .10)
<span class="citation">(Kline 2016)</span>. In cases of misfit, we
conservatively altered models using an a priori defined analysis
pipeline (see online supplementary material). As a “reality check,” we
tested items for potential ceiling and floor effects. If means were
below 1.5 or above 6.5, we preregistered to exclude these items.
However, as no item was outside these thresholds, no items were
excluded.</p>
<p>We wanted to find out <em>who</em> needs privacy, and not so much
<em>what causes</em> the need for privacy. Hence, to answer our research
question, in a joint model combining all variables (including
sociodemographic variables) we analyzed the variables’ bivariate
relations. To predict the need for privacy, we first used the six
personality factors. Afterward, we predicted privacy using the more
specific facets. To get a first idea of the variables’ potential causal
relations <span class="citation">(Grosz, Rohrer, and Thoemmes
2020)</span>, we also planned to run latent structural regression
models. However, because model fit was not acceptable, in exploratory
analyses we investigated the potential effects in a multiple regression
using the mean values of the observed scores.</p>
<p>We used two measures as inference criteria: statistical significance
and effect size. Regarding statistical significance, we used an alpha
value of 10%. Regarding effect size, we defined a SESOI of <em>r</em> =
.10, and thereby a null-region ranging from -.10 to .10. As proposed by
<span class="citation">Dienes (2014)</span>, we considered effects to be
meaningful if the confidence interval fell outside of the null region
(e.g., .15 to .25 or -.15 to -.25). We considered effects irrelevant if
the confidence interval fell completely within the null region (e.g.,
.02 to .08). And we suspended judgement if the confidence intervals
partially included the null region (e.g., .05 to .15).</p>
<p>Fully latent SEMs seldom work instantly, often requiring
modifications to achieve satisfactory model fit. Although we explicated
our analysis pipeline, there still remained several researcher degrees
of freedom. We planned to use fully latent SEM because we consider it
superior to regular analyses such as correlation or regression using
manifest variables <span class="citation">(Kline 2016)</span>. However,
when all measures were analyzed together in one single SEM model fit was
subpar. We hence decided to report the more conservative correlations of
average scores. In the online supplementary material, we also share the
results of alternative analyses, such as fully latent SEMs.</p>
</div>
<div id="measures" class="section level2">
<h2>Measures</h2>
<p>All items were answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1
(<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 7 (<em>strongly agree</em>).<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A list of
all items that we used are reported in the online supplementary
material. The personality and privacy items were presented in random
order, and the sociodemographic questions were asked at the end. In the
online supplementary material we also report all item statistics and
their distribution plots.</p>
<div id="need-for-privacy" class="section level3">
<h3>Need for privacy</h3>
<p>Although there exist several operationalizations of need for privacy
<span class="citation">(Buss 2001; Pedersen 1979; Frener, Dombrowski,
and Trepte 2023; Marshall 1974)</span>, we are not aware of one
encompassing, comprehensive, and up-to-date scale. Hence, we used both
existing scales and self-developed items, some of which were tested in
our pilot study. Ad-hoc scales were validated using the following
procedure: We (a) collected qualitative feedback from three privacy
experts;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
(b) followed the procedure implemented by <span
class="citation">Patalay, Hayes, and Wolpert (2018)</span> to test (and
adapt) the items using four established readability indices (i.e.,
Flesch–Kincaid reading grade, Gunning Fog Index, Coleman Liau Index, and
the Dale–Chall Readability Formula); (c) like <span
class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte (2023)</span>, assessed
convergent validity by collecting single-item measures of privacy
concern and privacy behavior, for which we expect to find small to
moderate correlations; and (d) analyzed all items in confirmatory factor
analyses as outlined above.</p>
<p>Overall, we collected 32 items measuring need for privacy, with eight
subdimensions that all consisted of four items each. Three subdimensions
captured horizontal privacy—namely <em>psychological</em>,
<em>social</em>, and <em>physical</em> privacy from other individuals.
Psychological and physical privacy were adopted from <span
class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte (2023)</span>. Because
<span class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte (2023)</span>
could not successfully operationalize the dimension of social privacy,
building on <span class="citation">Burgoon (1982)</span> we
self-designed a new social privacy dimension, which in the prestudy
showed satisfactory fit. Two subdimensions measured vertical privacy.
The first subdimension was <em>government surveillance</em>, which
represents the extent to which people want the government to abstain
from collecting information about them. The scale was pretested and
showed good factorial validity. The second subdimension was need for
privacy from <em>companies</em>, which we measured using four new
self-designed items. Finally, three subdimensions captured general
privacy. The first subdimension was <em>informational</em> privacy, with
items adopted from <span class="citation">Frener, Dombrowski, and Trepte
(2023)</span>. The second subdimension was <em>anonymity</em>, which
captured the extent to which people feel the need to avoid
identification in general. The scale was pretested and showed good
factorial validity; one new item was designed for this study. Third, we
also collected a new self-developed measure of <em>general</em> need for
privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="personality" class="section level3">
<h3>Personality</h3>
<p>Personality was measured using the HEXACO personality inventory. The
inventory consists of six factors with four facets each, including the
additional meta scale of “altruism.”</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>We first tested the factorial validity of all measures. When analyzed
individually, most measures showed satisfactory model fit, not requiring
any changes. Some measures showed satisfactory model fit after small
adaptions, such as allowing items to covary. In terms of reliability,
most measures showed satisfactory results. However, some measures such
as altruism, unconventionality, or anonymity showed insufficient
reliability. Instead of strongly adapting measures, we decided to
maintain the initial factor structure and did not delete any items and
we did not introduce substantial changes to the factors. For an overview
of all measures, their descriptives and factorial validity, see Table
@ref(tab:tab-des). Although individually most of the measures showed
good fit, when analyzed together fit decreased substantially, below
acceptable levels. As a result, we conservatively decided to analyze our
data using the variables’ observed mean scores.</p>

<p>The need for privacy measures showed good convergent validity. If
respondents reported higher needs for privacy they were also more
concerned about their privacy, with coefficients ranging from <em>r</em>
= .21 to <em>r</em> = .73. The only exception was the relation between
privacy concerns and the need for social privacy, which was very small
(<em>r</em> = .09). If respondents reported higher needs for privacy
they also engaged in more privacy behaviors, with coefficients ranging
from <em>r</em> = .20 to <em>r</em> = .71 The only exception was the
relation between privacy behavior and the need for social privacy, which
was virtually nonexistent (<em>r</em> = .01), and the need for physical
privacy, which was very small (<em>r</em> = .09). See online
supplementary material for all results.</p>
<p>People who reported being less honest and humble needed more
anonymity (<em>r</em> = -.17, 90% CI -.21, -.13). Looking at facets,
more anonymity was needed by people who reported being less fair
(<em>r</em> = -.18, 90% CI -.22, -.14), less modest (<em>r</em> = -.16,
90% CI -.20, -.12), and less altruistic (<em>r</em> = -.25, 90% CI -.29,
-.21). People who reported being less fair needed more psychological
(<em>r</em> = -.17, 90% CI -.21, -.13), social (<em>r</em> = -.23, 90%
CI -.27, -.19), and physical privacy (<em>r</em> = -.17, 90% CI -.22,
-.13). Similarly, people who reported being less altruistic also needed
substantially more psychological (<em>r</em> = -.28, 90% CI -.32, -.24),
social (<em>r</em> = -.28, 90% CI -.32, -.24), and physical privacy
(<em>r</em> = -.14, 90% CI -.18, -.10). However, less sincere people
needed less privacy from companies (<em>r</em> = .16, 90% CI .12, .20)
and less privacy in general (<em>r</em> = .15, 90% CI .11, .19). Effects
were small to medium in size.</p>
<p>Several relations between emotionality and need for privacy were
found. More emotional people needed less psychological privacy
(<em>r</em> = -.20, 90% CI -.24, -.16), less privacy from the government
(<em>r</em> = -.14, 90% CI -.18, -.10), less anonymity (<em>r</em> =
-.15, 90% CI -.19, -.11)—but also needed more physical privacy
(<em>r</em> = .20, 90% CI .16, .24). More anxious respondents needed
substantially more social (<em>r</em> = .33, 90% CI .29, .36) and
physical privacy (<em>r</em> = .38, 90% CI .34, .41). Similarly, more
fearful respondents needed more social (<em>r</em> = .14, 90% CI .10,
.18) and physical privacy (<em>r</em> = .27, 90% CI .23, .30). More
dependent participants generally needed less privacy, including less
psychological (<em>r</em> = -.47, 90% CI -.51, -.44) and social privacy
(<em>r</em> = -.29, 90% CI -.32, -.25), less privacy from the government
(<em>r</em> = -.15, 90% CI -.19, -.11), and less informational
(<em>r</em> = -.18, 90% CI -.22, -.14) and general privacy (<em>r</em> =
-.16, 90% CI -.20, -.12). A similar picture for more sentimental
participants emerged, who needed less psychological (<em>r</em> = -.27,
90% CI -.31, -.23) and social privacy (<em>r</em> = -.18, 90% CI -.22,
-.14) and less anonymity (<em>r</em> = -.18, 90% CI -.22, -.14).</p>
<p>More extraverted people reported they needed a lot less privacy. They
wanted less psychological privacy (<em>r</em> = -.46, 90% CI -.49,
-.42), social privacy (<em>r</em> = -.77, 90% CI -.78, -.75), and
physical privacy (<em>r</em> = -.55, 90% CI -.58, -.53), less
informational privacy (<em>r</em> = -.22, 90% CI -.26, -.18) and less
anonymity (<em>r</em> = -.19, 90% CI -.23, -.15). Effect sizes were
oftentimes large. All facets showed virtually the same relations, with
small differences in effect sizes.</p>
<p>More agreeable participants showed a similar pattern. They needed
less psychological (<em>r</em> = -.21, 90% CI -.25, -.17), social
(<em>r</em> = -.37, 90% CI -.41, -.34), and physical privacy (<em>r</em>
= -.38, 90% CI -.41, -.34). The facets showed virtually the same
pattern. Effect sizes were substantial, but on the whole smaller than
those for extraversion.</p>
<p>Although more conscientious respondents generally needed less
privacy, the pattern was varied. More conscientious respondents needed
less psychological (<em>r</em> = -.15, 90% CI -.19, -.11) and less
social privacy (<em>r</em> = -.24, 90% CI -.28, -.20), as well as less
anonymity (<em>r</em> = -.17, 90% CI -.21, -.12). However, when asked
about privacy in general more conscientious people responded to need
more (<em>r</em> = .17, 90% CI .13, .21). More conscientious people also
needed more privacy from companies (<em>r</em> = .14, 90% CI .10, .18).
Looking at facets of conscientiousness, more organized people needed
less social privacy (<em>r</em> = -.24, 90% CI -.28, -.20) and less
anonymity (<em>r</em> = -.14, 90% CI -.18, -.10). More prudent
participants needed less anonymity (<em>r</em> = -.17, 90% CI -.21,
-.13). More diligent people needed less psychological (<em>r</em> =
-.21, 90% CI -.25, -.17), social (<em>r</em> = -.32, 90% CI -.36, -.29),
and physical privacy (<em>r</em> = -.18, 90% CI -.22, -.14) as well as
less anonymity (<em>r</em> = -.16, 90% CI -.20, -.12)—but also more
privacy from companies (<em>r</em> = .14, 90% CI .10, .18) At the same
time, more perfectionist respondents reported needing more informational
(<em>r</em> = .20, 90% CI .16, .24) privacy, privacy from companies
(<em>r</em> = .14, 90% CI .10, .18), and more general privacy
(<em>r</em> = .26, 90% CI .22, .30).</p>
<p>Whether or not respondents were open to new experiences was in most
cases unrelated to how much privacy they needed. People more open to
experiences needed more privacy from companies (<em>r</em> = .15, 90% CI
.10, .19) and more privacy in general (<em>r</em> = .15, 90% CI .10,
.19). Three facets showed relevant but still small relations.
Respondents who reported being more creative needed less psychological
(<em>r</em> = -.15, 90% CI -.19, -.11) and less social privacy
(<em>r</em> = -.16, 90% CI -.20, -.12). More inquisitive respondents
needed less physical privacy (<em>r</em> = -.15, 90% CI -.20, -.11) but
more privacy from companies (<em>r</em> = .14, 90% CI .10, .18).</p>

<p>Not many meaningful relations between sociodemographic variables and

</div>
<p>In exploratory analyses we analyzed how personality facets might have
potentially caused need for privacy, using multiple regressions in which
we controlled for all personality dimensions and sociodemographic
variables. We found that the need for psychological privacy was
explained by two variables: extraversion (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.55, 90% CI -.60, -.50) and
emotionality (<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> =
-.28, 90% CI -.33, -.24). The need for social privacy was also
potentially affected by extraversion and emotionality. Being more
extraverted substantially decreased the need for psychological privacy
(<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.80, 90% CI
-.83, -.77), as did being more emotional (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.16, 90% CI -.19, -.12).
Physical privacy was determined by again extraversion, but also by
agreeableness and conscientiousness. Being more extraverted appeared to
decrease the need for physical privacy (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.53, 90% CI -.58, -.49);
being more agreeable likewise decreased the need for physical privacy
(<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.17, 90% CI
-.22, -.12); however, being more conscientious increased the need for
physical privacy (<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> =
.17, 90% CI .12, .21). The need for privacy from the government was
affected by the two factors of openness and conservatism. Being more
open to new experiences potentially increased the need for privacy from
the government (<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> =
.17, 90% CI .12, .22), as did being more politically conservative
(<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = .22, 90% CI .17,
.27). The need for privacy from companies was affected by the openness
to new experiences only. Being more open to new experiences potentially
increased the need for privacy from companies (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = .17, 90% CI .12, .22). Being
extraverted and conscientious affected the need for informational
privacy. Whereas being more extraverted decreased the need for
informational privacy (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.29, 90% CI -.35, -.24),
being more conscientious increased the need for informational privacy
(<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = .22, 90% CI .17,
.27) in our data. The need for anonymity was meaningfully affected only
by extraversion. More extraverted people need less anonymity (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.20, 90% CI -.26, -.15).
Finally, the general need for privacy was affected by four variables.
Being extraverted again decreased the general need for privacy
(<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = -.22, 90% CI
-.28, -.17). However, the general need for privacy was increased by
being more conscientious (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = .22, 90% CI .17, .27), more
conservative (<em><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = .18,
90% CI .13, .22), and more open to experiences (<em><span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></em> = .19, 90% CI .14, .23).</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>In this study we analyzed the relation between personality and need
for privacy. The data came from <em>N</em> = 1550 respondents from the
US, representative in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity. The results
showed several meaningful relations between personality and need for
privacy that were statistically significant and not trivial in size
(i.e., 90% CI <em>r</em> <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span>
.10).</p>
<p>As expected, the need for privacy was most closely related to
extraversion. Participants who were more extraverted generally needed
substantially less privacy. The relation between extraversion and social
privacy was particularly large, suggesting that social privacy and
extraversion overlap conceptually. In addition, almost all subscales of
extraversion showed similar patterns: People with greater social
boldness, self-esteem, or liveliness all needed substantially less
privacy from other people and less physical, psychological, and
informational privacy. Extraverted people reach out to others, share
their inner lives, are confident around others—which reflects in a
reduced need for privacy.</p>
<p>The personality factor next closely related to need for privacy was
agreeableness. More agreeable respondents needed less privacy in
general. In particular, more agreeable respondents needed substantially
less psychological, social, and physical privacy. Although this finding
aligned with our prior expectation, we were surprised by the strength of
the relations. Because more agreeable people have fewer conflicts with
others and are more easy to get along with, they likely see others less
as a threat, and hence have a reduced need for privacy. Like as was
found for extraversion, no relevant relations with need for privacy from
government and companies exist, suggesting that agreeableness and
extraversion—personality traits mostly relevant in interpersonal
contexts—might not extend to the need for privacy in these public
domains.</p>
<p>In analyzing how the honesty humility factor relates to need for
privacy, we investigated the nothing-to-hide argument. As expected, our
results provided support for the nothing-to-hide argument, especially
with regard to the need for anonymity. Respondents who needed more
anonymity were less honest, less fair, less modest, and less altruistic.
Respondents who were less fair and less altruistic also needed more
psychological, social, and physical privacy. Less honest participants
desired more anonymity and privacy from other people, be it
psychologically, socially, or physically. These findings align with a
recent study indicating that individuals with lower levels of honesty
are more inclined to seek anonymity online, for example to engage in
toxic communication <span class="citation">(Nitschinsk et al.
2023)</span>. However, honesty was unrelated to the need for privacy
from government and companies or informational and general privacy. If
anything, people who were more sincere actually desired more privacy
from companies and more privacy in general. So although less honest
people needed more privacy in several dimensions, this pattern is not
uni-dimensional but somewhat varied and nuanced.</p>
<p>Emotionality showed mixed relations with need for privacy, which
confirmed our ambivalent a priori expectations. More emotional people
desired less psychological privacy, less privacy from the government,
and less anonymity. At the same time, they needed more physical privacy.
Whereas they may want tighter relational bonds to people close to them,
they appear to be warier of strangers entering their personal physical
spaces. Fearful and anxious people wanted more social and more physical
privacy, while dependent and sensitive people wanted less. It seems that
more emotional people have a subtle and varied approach to privacy
depending on the nature of their emotionality. This is consistent with
research on discrete emotions which finds that certain negative
emotions—fear and anxiety in particular—evoke the aversive motivational
system that facilitates avoidance behaviors, whereas other emotions,
possibly including dependence and social sensitivity, activate an
appetitive motivational system that facilitates approach behaviors <span
class="citation">(Phaf et al. 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Contrary to our expectations, conscientiousness showed varied
relations with need for privacy. More conscientious people needed less
psychological and social privacy and less anonymity. Asked about privacy
from companies and privacy in general, however, they answered they
needed more. More perfectionist people preferred both more informational
privacy, privacy from companies, and more privacy in general—perhaps to
have more options and leeway to adapt plans or hide imperfections. More
diligent people needed less privacy from other people, less
psychological privacy, and less physical privacy. Speculating about a
potential explanation, we could imagine that similar to the
nothing-to-hide argument more diligent people might have less to be
afraid of and so are more open to public scrutiny.</p>
<p>Although openness might be the opposite of privacy semantically,
empirically only a handful of meaningful relations with need for privacy
were found. And interestingly, the main dimension showed that more open
people actually wanted more privacy from companies and more privacy in
general. The facet creativity was meaningfully related to psychological
and social privacy, such that more creative people needed less
psychological and social privacy. It might be that more creative people
generally think of others as resources, thriving from their inputs and
exchanges. More inquisitive people needed less physical privacy from
others. They, too, might see others as a resource, valuing closer
exchanges with people unknown to them.</p>
<p>In addition, we looked at relations between need for privacy and
various sociodemographic variables. Contrary to our expectations, older
participants desired less privacy from others, both socially and
physically. This was surprising, for example given that older people
report increased online privacy concern <span class="citation">(Kezer et
al. 2016)</span>. It is an open question as to whether this relation
represents a developmental mechanism or a difference between cohorts.
Research suggests that older people have fewer social interactions than
younger people <span class="citation">(Ortiz-Ospina, Giattino, and Roser
2024)</span>, which could result in a lower need for social and physical
privacy. But it could also be a difference between cohorts. Younger
people nowadays have fewer in-person social contacts than before, often
attributed to increases in time spent online <span
class="citation">(Twenge, Spitzberg, and Campbell 2019)</span>. Hence,
it could also be that younger generations prefer more solitude than the
generations beforehand.</p>
<p>We expected that males would desire more psychological privacy but
less social and physical privacy than females. Although in our data
these relations were statistically significant, the effects sizes were
too small to be considered meaningful. The only meaningful gender effect
we found was with regard to anonymity. Males needed more anonymity than
females. This finding is in line with the fact that women more readily
view themselves as vulnerable and targets for victimization than do men
<span class="citation">(Lewyn 1993)</span>.</p>
<p>People in relationships needed less social privacy. This makes sense
as being in a relationship implies a minimum commitment of openness to
others. Contrary to our expectations, respondents with a college degree
and with greater income all reported lower levels of need for social
privacy. Having fewer educational and financial resources might result
in greater social stigma, leading to an increased need for social
privacy. More politically conservative respondents needed more privacy
from the government—which we expected given the general political
tendencies of conservatives to prefer fewer state regulations and
interferences. Finally, no meaningful relations with ethnicity were
found. For example, contrary to what we expected we did not find that
minority groups desired more privacy from the government in our
data.</p>
<p>The results above are based on correlations and analyzed the
variables’ relationships. To analyze the potential impact of personality
on need for privacy, in exploratory analyses we also ran several
multiple regression analyses. Here, we estimated the relations between
each personality and need for privacy dimension while controlling for
all other personality dimensions and sociodemographics. Results were
comparable, in that extraversion turned out to be the major potential
cause of need for privacy. However, there were also some differences.
Most notably, results implied that being more conscientious increases
the need for physical, informational, and general privacy. Similarly,
being more open to new experiences might increase the need for privacy
from the government, from companies, and for privacy in general.
Finally, multiple regression results suggested that being conservative
does not only increase the need for privacy from the government but also
for privacy in general. All other sociodemographic variables ceased to
be significant.</p>
<p>Looking at the results more broadly, we make five general
observations. First, it makes sense to differentiate different levels of
need for privacy. Many personality traits showed meaningful relations
with some dimension, yet no or even opposite relations with others. To
illustrate, whereas more conscientious people desired less psychological
privacy and less privacy from other, when asked about privacy in general
and privacy from companies they needed more. General need for privacy
may rather represent a cognitive appraisal, whereas social or
psychological privacy might be more experienced-based and psychological.
In any case, our results argue for a more rather than less nuanced
strategy for measuring privacy attitudes.y</p>
<p>Second, the need for privacy from companies and the government, both
vertical forms of privacy, showed only a couple of meaningful relations
with personality. The most notable relation was that conservative people
needed substantially more privacy from the government. Most relations
between privacy needs and personality were found for forms of horizontal
privacy, suggesting that personality has more influence on the more
social and interpersonal aspects of privacy. So while the demographic
variable of political ideology more strongly affected vertical privacy
needs, personality aspects appear to better explain horizontal privacy
needs.</p>
<p>Third, although we found support for the nothing-to-hide-argument,
our results also support the reasoning of the argument’s critics.
Although desiring more anonymity was related to less honesty, fairness,
and altruism, these relations were not particularly large. Next, it is
insufficient to assume that anonymity is needed only by people with
reduced honesty. Less emotional, less extraverted, and more
conscientious people also needed more anonymity. Finally, when analyzed
together with the other predictors, honesty and humility ceased to be a
relevant predictor.</p>
<p>This leads to our fourth general observation. Our main interest was
to determine the personality factors predicting the need for privacy.
What can we learn about a person given their need for privacy? We first
analyzed this question in correlation analyses. However, when we further
explored potential causal effects using multiple regression analysis
<span class="citation">(Grosz, Rohrer, and Thoemmes 2020)</span>, a
somewhat different picture emerged. Several of the bivariate
relationships we initially observed disappeared. These results suggest
that some of the correlations we found might not be due to a direct
causal process but could instead be explained by shared variance with a
third confounding factor. Additionally, some causal effects that were
not apparent in the correlation analyses became significant in the
multiple regressions. Specifically, conservatism became more relevant
when we included additional control variables, suggesting that an
increase in conservatism leads to a greater desire for anonymity and
privacy in general.</p>
<p>Finally, our results have significant implications for privacy
theory, suggesting new avenues for further research. Given the close
relationship between personality and privacy, it is worthwhile to
examine how personality traits interact with specific privacy models and
theories. For instance, personality could influence the privacy calculus
model <span class="citation">(Kezer, Dienlin, and Baruh 2022)</span>.
Extraverted individuals, who tend to view others as resources, might
perceive greater benefits in sharing information online and therefore be
more open in their sharing behaviors. Conversely, anxious individuals,
who are more likely to see others as threats, might have heightened
concerns about privacy, leading to a reduced willingness to share
information online.</p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Not all personality and privacy measures showed good fit. Especially
when analyzed together, fit was not satisfactory. Likewise, some
measures such as altruism, unconventionality, or anonymity showed low
reliability. The results of these variables thus need to be interpreted
more cautiously.</p>
<p>Instead of deleting items or changing the factor structure, to avoid
over-fitting we decided to maintain the measures’ original factor
structure. For this reason, instead of reporting the results from latent
structural equation modelling, we reported the results of the
correlations of the observed variables’ means. Interested readers can
find the results of the latent analyses in our online supplementary
material. The results are highly comparable, with the major difference
that effect sizes in the latent models tended to be larger. The results
reported here are hence more conservative and likely underestimate the
true effect sizes. This underscores the need for further optimizing
measures of personality and privacy.</p>
<p>In our exploratory analyses, we aimed to investigate the potential
causal effects of personality on the need for privacy by controlling for
potential confounders, including other personality dimensions and
sociodemographic variables. However, it is important to note that this
is only a preliminary approach, as there are likely additional variables
that could further explain the relationships. Future research should
explore the potential causal relationships in a more systematic and
comprehensive manner.</p>
<p>Our findings are specific to the U.S. context. Previous research
indicates that although privacy is a universal concept, attitudes and
practices vary significantly across different cultures and countries
<span class="citation">(Altman 1977)</span>. It is possible that the
relationship between personality and the need for privacy manifests
differently in various settings. We hope this study will serve as a
catalyst for future research in this area.</p>
