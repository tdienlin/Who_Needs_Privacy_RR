<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Reviews of original submission</h1>

</div>


<p>Below you can find the reviews for the original submission</p>
<div id="editor" class="section level1">
<h1>Editor</h1>
<p>Dear Dr Tobias Dienlin,</p>
<p>Thank you for trusting your manuscript “Who Needs Privacy” for review
by Collabra: Psychology. I sent the paper to two scholars who
collectively have expertise concerning personality traits,
cyber-psychology, and research methods. These individuals are
extraordinarily well qualified to review this paper and I thank them for
their service to this journal. I independently read the paper and then
consulted the comments from the reviewers.</p>
<p>As you will read below, the reviewers thought the topic was
interesting and worthy of study. They also noted that the paper is well
written. However, the reviewers raised a number of significant questions
and offered constructive suggestions for improvement,
reconceptualization, and extension. The nature of the suggested
improvements are substantial and seem to require additional samples.
Indeed, I think a new and larger sample will be required to address the
reviewer comments. Thus, I am sorry to say that my decision is to the
submission for publication based on the peer review recommendations. I
would, however, be open to a new manuscript that includes a second
larger sample (at least) that addresses the concerns of the reviewers
with respect to evidence of replication, consideration of alternative
analytic frameworks, and enhanced attention to measurement. I also think
a sample with a wider age range might prove to be a useful compliment to
the sample in the sample. However, a large sample of college students
might also work.</p>
<p>Regardless of this decision, I hope you find the reviews helpful as
you decide on the next steps for this work. Below I outline some of the
reasons that figured most prominently in my decision. I urge you to pay
particular attention to reviewer feedback as I think their reactions are
especially insightful.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I agree with concerns about re-labeling the NEO PI-R facets. I
actually think it might prove useful to use a long facet-based measure
and keep labels consistent with those commonly used in the literature.
The machine learning approach suggested by Reviewer B is
intriguing.</p></li>
<li><p>I agree with the concerns of the reviewers about the need for
additional studies to make sure there is adequate power and precision as
well as evidence that the measures have acceptable levels of validity
for the research purposes. This is the major reason why I elected to
reject the paper. I think the current evidence is too preliminary to
meet the rigor bar set for work published in this outlet.</p></li>
<li><p>Reviewer A raises an interesting conundrum about the overlap
between a need for privacy and sociability. This is something to
consider when interpreting the results.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, I am sorry to deliver unwelcome news. My decision boiled
down to concerns about the strength of the current contribution in light
of the expectations for rigor for papers at this outlet. I think the
idea of identifying personality correlates for privacy concerns is
interesting. The Reviewers and I simply concluded that additional study
is needed to make a stronger case for the approach and ideas advanced in
the paper. Regardless of this decision, I wish you well as you pursue
these topics.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Brent Donnellan Senior Editor</p>

<p>This manuscript reports a cross-sectional correlational survey study
on the link between privacy needs and various personality traits. The
topic is interesting, and the manuscript is written in an accessible,
transparent way, for which the authors should be applauded. However, I
also thought there were several weaknesses, both conceptually (which may
be addressed) and with regards to the empirical work. To this end, it
may be reasonable to conduct a follow-up study (but this is a decision
that should be made by the editor handling this manuscript).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The introduction and theoretical background is overall solid. The
authors acknowledge that that the available evidence in this area is a)
limited and b) results are rather mixed. As such, they carefully develop
hypotheses but make it quite clear that the work is generally quite
exploratory. I had a few thoughts that the authors might find helpful
should they be given the opportunity to revise their manuscript:</p>
<p>p. 3, l. 34: „We think that a better understanding of the relation
between personality and privacy is crucial” Perhaps it is, but the
authors do not really say why. Other than academic interest, why is a
better understanding “crucial”? A paragraph laying out the relevance of
research on the link between personality and privacy, either in the
introduction or the discussion, would be helpful.</p>
<p>p. 8, l. 178: “Somewhat related, prior empirical research has shown
that people who are more concerned about their privacy are also more
likely to withdraw online, for example by deleting posts or untagging
themselves from linked content (Dienlin &amp; Metzger, 2016).” Maybe I’m
just not understanding the connection, but maybe the authors could
explain how this is even “somewhat” related to the level of general
anxiety.</p>
<p>p. 8, l. 184 to p. 9, l. 194: I found this entire paragraph on the
link between anxiety and consent to government surveillance somewhat
unconvincing. It is plausible that anxiety correlates with being in
favor of government surveillance; however, this does not necessarily
extend to someone’s own data. One can be in favor of government
surveillance programmes and a high need for privacy. Maybe this
paragraph just needs some slight editing to emphasize the point the
authors are trying to make here (similar to p. 9, l. 207: one can desire
privacy with regards to their own information or data and still be in
favor of governmental surveillance measures to avert threats).</p>
<p>Maybe writing this will get me a ticket straight to personality
psychology hell, but since the authors have already moved away from
personality factors and instead consider facets (e.g. gregariousness
instead of extraversion, p. 5), is it not conceivable that “need for
privacy”, too, is another of those facets? Or maybe why it’s not! I’m
not suggesting it actually is (I’m very much agnostic on that question)
but maybe considering the idea would help the authors more clearly
distinguish between the many constructs and also types of constructs
they introduce and connect in their manuscript. In particular, I find it
currently difficult to understand the meaningful difference between
sociability (“whether people prefer to spend their time alone or with
company”) and privacy (“a voluntary withdrawal from society”) as
introduced in the manuscript.</p>
<p>DATA ANALYSIS</p>
<p>p. 11, l. 257: “Because all predictors were chosen on the basis of
a-priori reasoning we did not control for alpha inflation.” That is not
a reason not to control for alpha inflation. If anything, in fact, one
might even argue that it would be a good reason to do the opposite,
i.e. apply some sort of inflation correction: Committing an alpha or
Type I error means rejecting a true null hypothesis. When one is in
“discovery mode”, or largely exploring, there could be an argument to
set alpha relatively high (.1 or maybe even .2) in order to balance it
with Type II errors and not miss potentially important relationships (at
the cost of a greater number of false positives). However, when one is
relatively sure that observed variables are indeed related, there is no
good reason to do so because p-values will tend to 0 and should not be
“just below .05” anyway (I will return to this point later in my
review). Here, it is more important that they survive “stricter”
thresholds (as there should not be many false negatives). This is not to
say I am asking the authors to definitely apply some correction method
(although they reasonably might), but to reconsider the argument they
present to have alpha fixed at .05.</p>
<p>MEASURES</p>
<p>Quite a few items from validated scales were dropped. I am not a big
fan of this practice, and the authors note that it is certainly not
ideal, but mention that it did not make a huge difference. Maybe they
could expand a little what this means in practice (e.g. whether the
bivariate correlations change meaningfully, etc).</p>
<p>I found it striking that the correlation between privacy need
government and privacy need anonymity was &gt; .8, which seems to
suggest these two factors treated separately are massively overlapping.
Maybe it would be good if the authors expanded a little on this.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>Currently, I see the greatest issues with the results of the
statistical analyses, or rather, their interpretation, in the context of
the observed sample size and predefined SESOI. To me it seems that with
the exception of the link between Sociability and Privacy need
Interpersonal, all hypotheses should be rejected. This is greatly
visualized in Figure 2, where a number of interesting observations can
be made</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>all but one of the 95% CIs overlap with the equivalence region</li>
<li>all but the age CIs are actually wider than the equivalence region,
which means that for most variables, the precision was too low to
perform meaningful equivalence tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>From what I understand, the authors did not actually conduct
equivalence tests (otherwise they would have used 90% CIs instead of
95%), but use the thresholds descriptively (i.e. without testing
“against” them). Still, taking into account the standard errors makes
sense, but also implies that almost all of the coefficients are not
larger than the authors’ defined smallest effect size of interest. This
is further corroborated by the observed p-values reported in Table 3 (in
increasing order, &lt; .05 only): &lt; .001, .004, .008, .011, .025,
.027, .031, .036, .037, .042. Under the assumption of true alternative
hypotheses, this distribution of p-values should be quite rare, as they
seem to tend away from rather than to 0. Even a very relaxed alpha
inflation correction (e.g., fixed alpha/2, would have rendered 50% of
these p-values nonsignificant). This, of course, would change the
interpretation and discussion substantially, and I am happy to see
counterarguments by the authors.</p>
<p>Notably, I am wholly unconvinced by the last paragraph in the results
section (p. 19, l. 397 an onwards), purportedly presenting arguments why
the results cannot be explained by chance alone. Although the authors
seem to be very careful in their statistical inference (defining SESOIs,
discussing power, etc), this paragraph seems to reintroduce several
common misconceptions about p-values that they elsewhere carefully
avoid, the most important being that P-values are conditional
probabilities and as such cannot be used to infer that the results could
not have been explained by chance alone (this is why we define a priori
error rates). This entire paragraph is built on the comparison of the
observations with a hypothetical “null hypotheses”. However, as far as I
can tell, the study tested a very large number of hypotheses (at least
24), and as such, speaking of one uniform null would be the most extreme
case (24 out of 24 hypotheses are false). But just consider that, say 20
out or 24 tested hypotheses are actually false. Would observing 11
significant tests be so unusual? What about under 19 out of 24, or 17?
These comparisons are meaningless as they do not tell us which of the 11
significant tests represent true hypotheses, and which are false
positives.</p>
<p>DISCUSSION</p>
<p>I will limit my comments on the discussion for now as, depending on
the revision of the manuscript, it might look very different from what
is currently reported (see above).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Overall, the research topic is interesting, and the authors wrote up
a transparent, accessible report. However, I wonder, given the concerns
identified, the potentially insufficient precision, and the fact that
the authors failed to meet their own sample target (300), whether it
might not be the best route to conduct a follow-up study to substantiate
many of these initial findings. This would also put a suggestion to the
test the authors make on p. 19, l. 395: that a larger study, which
yields smaller standard errors, would find additional effects. This is
certainly possible, but it is also entirely conceivable that some of the
initially observed effects would be smaller (regression to the
mean).</p>

<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to review this manuscript. By
evaluating the individual characteristics that relate to the perceived
need for privacy, it addresses a topic of increasing social relevance
and I think there is a need for more research along these lines. I also
applaud the authors’ use of advanced analytic methods and their efforts
to address issues important to open science.</p>
<p>That said, I feel the impact of this work is limited by their
methodological approach. Specifically, I find myself unable to endorse
their approach to measurement due to two concerns.</p>
<p>The first and more straight-forward concern relates to their measures
of privacy. The standards for new measures that are derived through
rational methods (the approach taken here) increasingly require more
extensive procedures than those that are described in this manuscript.
For example, it is becoming standard practice to attain expert input via
qualitative data collection for concept elicitation (not mentioned here)
in addition to an exhaustive literature review (conducted, at least in
part, for this manuscript though it would be helpful to more directly
explain how the prior research described in the introduction ties to
procedures used to develop this measure of privacy). Ideally, when
budgets allow, one would also co-administer extant measures of the
construct before choosing content for preliminary/potential inclusion in
the new measure, as this allows for more informed understanding of the
overlapping and unique features of prior operationalizations. It is also
important that the preliminary content is evaluated across a range of
qualitative attributes (e.g., literacy levels, readability, avoidance of
colloquialisms, etc.) prior to large scale data collection. I should
note that the final items (in Table 2) look pretty good with respect to
these qualitative attributes but little detail is given about the
procedures used to write the new content. Then, the overly-inclusive
pool of preliminary items would be administered to one or more large and
representative sample(s) – EFAs and CFAs would not be used on the same
data. Optimally, EFA results would be replicated before moving to
confirmatory evaluations of fit. Finally, once a final set of items has
been identified on the basis of these structural analyses, reports on
their psychometric properties should be made. The authors did a nice job
of addressing questions about dimensionality and reliability but
validation evidence was lacking. It is most common for these procedures
to be detailed in a stand-alone project/publication, and sometimes more
than one. Of course, validation is an on-going endeavor and I think this
paper would constitute a nice example of a validation project if the
measure had previously been introduced in prior work (using something
like the steps described above).</p>
<p>My second concern is more subtle than the first, but not less
important. It relates to the authors’ approach to measuring the other
facets of personality. After reading the abstract, I was immediately
curious to know which measurement framework the authors had used for
personality assessment, as it was clear that they had deviated from
using one of the mainstream assessment models – not necessarily a
problem on its own merits, but this does introduce some challenges in
terms of situating the findings relative to other personality research.
As I proceeded through the introduction, I began to understand that they
endorsed a Big Five approach but were measuring unfamiliar facet-level
constructs. Only when reviewing the Measures section of the Methods did
I understand that they were using facets of the NEO-PI-R with different
names than the constructs being measured. While I am sympathetic to the
notion that there are many plausible features of personality that
<em>may</em> be covered by unnamed nooks and crannies of the NEO and
various other measurement frameworks (more technically, “homogenous item
clusters”), it is not valid to use – for example – the reversed scores
of the Actions facet of Openness to Experiences as a measure of
Traditionalism in the absence of empirical evidence confirming that this
measures what the authors claim it measures. Though cold comfort for the
authors, I understand the temptation to do this and I think stems from a
real weakness for our field – the fact that we do not have a strong
working knowledge of the nomological relations among
empirically-identified personality traits that are less abstract than
the Big Five.</p>
<p>I have a possible suggestion but it would require a substantial
overhaul to the text. If the authors happened to collect data on all 30
facets of the NEO (not clear) in addition to the privacy items, an
informative analysis would be to use machine learning methods capable of
showing the NEO items that are most predictive of the privacy variables
(whether scales or items). Some would argue that this constitutes
baseless data mining. To counter that argument (a little), a nice
addition might be pre-registration and analysis by someone who is not
familiar with the data/findings and/or the use of a training and test
sub-samples (given the size of this sample, I would recommend using it
as the training sample and then collecting a new sample as the test
set).</p>
<p>In addition to the comments provided here, I have attached a
marked-up copy of the manuscript with several more minor comments and
questions.</p>
