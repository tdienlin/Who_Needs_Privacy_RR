  abstract = {An account of privacy’s evolutionary roots may hold lessons for policies in the digital age           ,                             Continued expansion of human activities into digital realms gives rise to concerns about digital privacy and its invasions, often expressed in terms of data rights and internet surveillance. It may thus be tempting to construe privacy as a modern phenomenon—something our ancestors lacked and technological innovation and urban growth made possible. Research from history, anthropology, and ethnography suggests otherwise. The evidence for peoples seeking to manage the boundaries of private and public spans time and space, social class, and degree of technological sophistication. Privacy—not merely hiding of data, but the selective opening and closing of the self to others—appears to be both culturally specific and culturally universal (                                1                              ). But what could explain the simultaneous universality and diversity of a human drive for privacy? An account of the evolutionary roots of privacy may offer an answer and teach us about privacy’s digital future and how to manage it (                                2                              ).},

  abstract = {Privacy scholars have long studied, and argued about, a so-called privacy paradox---the alleged gap between individuals' claims of caring about privacy and their actual behaviors. This manuscript explores whether a different type of mismatch occurs in an online sample of US participants: a mismatch between participants' dismissive perspectives on privacy and their privacy-protective behaviors. In a series of online studies with Prolific US participants we tackle two research questions: is there evidence of mismatches between (dismissive) privacy perspectives, and (protective) privacy behaviors? If so, what can explain those mismatches? In a Behavior Elicitation study, we collect a corpus of privacy-regulating and privacy-protective behaviors. Next, in Study 1, we find evidence that engagement in a broad array of privacy behaviors is, in fact, very common in our sample. We also find that mismatches between dismissive privacy perspectives and protective behaviors emerge in a large proportion of participants. Finally, in Study 2, we uncover several common but distinct reasons for those mismatches, including construing seemingly protective behaviors as motivated by reasons other than privacy, and nuanced stances on when to express privacy concern. Collectively, the results indicate that individuals who are seemingly dismissive of privacy concerns engage in behaviors that can be construed as privacy-seeking. The findings highlight the nuances of individual privacy decision-making and suggest that public policy related to privacy should account for the evidence for widespread privacy-seeking behaviors.},

The present study expands this research by examining the relationships between ego development, moral reasoning, psychopathic personality, and three commonly used integrity tests. Both overt and personality-based integrity tests showed the strongest (negative) correlations with psychopathic personality but only modest correlations with ego development and moral reasoning. On the whole, these findings suggest that integrity tests may be more closely related to overt moral behavior than to moral reasoning.},

  abstract = {This paper critically analyzes the survey literature on trust in government and confidence in institutions. It highlights the gap between theoretical understandings of trust which encompass trust, lack of trust, and distrust, next to empirical realizations which fail to consider active distrust of government. Using a specially tailored survey designed for this project, the paper is the first which directly compares competing operationalizations of trust and distrust. The most frequently used measures, both from the National Election Studies and the General Social Survey, tend to exaggerate the level of disaffection compared to a new measure especially designed to run from active trust, which anticipates that the government will do the right thing, to active distrust, the expectation that it will do the wrong thing. Multivariate analyses reveal statistically significant differences in the underlying determinants of these measures. The conventional NES measure in particular is more influenced by short-term evaluations of political events and leaders; our new measure of active trust/distrust taps a more deeply seated orientation toward government.},

  abstract = {Answers to sensitive questions are prone to social desirability bias. If not properly addressed, the validity of the research can be suspect. This article presents multigroup item randomized response theory (MIRRT) to measure self-reported sensitive topics across cultures. The method was specifically developed to reduce social desirability bias by making an a priori change in the design of the survey. The change involves the use of a randomization device (e.g., a die) that preserves participants' privacy at the item level. In cases where multiple items measure a higher level theoretical construct, the researcher could still make inferences at the individual level. The method can correct for under- and overreporting, even if both occur in a sample of individuals or across nations. We present and illustrate MIRRT in a nontechnical manner, provide WinBugs software code so that researchers can directly implement it, and present 2 cross-national studies in which it was applied. The first study compared nonstudent samples from 2 countries (total n = 927) on permissive sexual attitudes and risky sexual behavior and related these to individual-level characteristics such as the Big Five personality traits. The second study compared nonstudent samples from 17 countries (total n = 6,195) on risky sexual behavior and related these to individual-level characteristics, such as gender and age, and to country-level characteristics, such as sex ratio.}

In the main study among 1,106 students and well-acquainted others (friends, family, or partners), positive self-other agreement correlations were found for both IM (r = .45) and Self-Deceptive Enhancement (SDE; r = .34), supporting a trait conception of IM and SDE. In both self- and other ratings, the most important predictors of SDE were (low) Emotionality, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness. IM was associated with Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, but Honesty-Humility was by far its most important predictor. In a subsample (n = 465), Honesty-Humility and IM were unrelated to GPA.}

Some researchers and public figures agree that privacy has changed substantially, that we are living in a post-privacy world, and that we need to address privacy differently. Conversely, others maintain that privacy remains a relevant concept in our society, and that, although facets and degrees of privacy change, the conceptual core and societal relevance remain unchanged and intact. In this paper, we discuss the current state and future of privacy, presenting two opposing stances on four central questions: Has privacy changed? Is privacy dead? Have we lost control over our own privacy? How should we react? With this dialogue we hope to provide an overview of current positions on privacy by presenting divergent lines of reasoning and thinking, while outlining potential paths forward.},

Participants, who ranged in age from 16 to the mid-80s, completed a 15-item version of the Big Five Inventory (e.g., John \& Srivastava, 1999) in either 2005 or 2006. The observed age trends were generally consistent across both datasets. Extraversion and Openness were negatively associated with age, whereas Agreeableness was positively associated with age. Average levels of Conscientiousness were highest for participants in middle age. The only exception was Neuroticism, which was slightly negatively associated with age in the BHPS and slightly positively associated with age in the GSEOP. Neither gender nor education level were consistent moderators of age differences in the Big Five.}

  abstract = {The need for privacy has been gaining importance in various disciplines and areas of communication, including computer-mediated, interpersonal, and health communication. These disciplines require reliable measurement of the need for privacy across different contexts. We propose a theoretical concept of the need for privacy as a personality trait and develop a multi-dimensional scale. In Study 1, we developed and tested the Need for Privacy Scale (NFP-S) using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (German internet users, n1 = 3,278; n2 = 1,226). The results support a second-order model with three first-order factors, i.e., informational, psychological, and physical need for privacy; social need for privacy was identified to be inherent to the three other dimensions and as such not a dimension on its own. The 12-item scale was validated with regard to loneliness, online privacy concerns, sex, online data protection and online information disclosure. In Study 2, we confirmed the factorial structure with a representative sample of N = 1,000 German internet users. We validated the scale with a self-assessment of the need for privacy, offline and online privacy concerns, online privacy literacy, social media usage, online data protection and social media self-disclosure, and sociodemographics.}

  abstract = {When something is wrong, someone is harmed. This hypothesis derives from the theory of dyadic morality, which suggests a moral cognitive template of wrongdoing agent and suffering patient (i.e., victim). This dyadic template means that victimless wrongs (e.g., masturbation) are psychologically incomplete, compelling the mind to perceive victims even when they are objectively absent. Five studies reveal that dyadic completion occurs automatically and implicitly: Ostensibly harmless wrongs are perceived to have victims (Study 1), activate concepts of harm (Studies 2 and 3), and increase perceptions of suffering (Studies 4 and 5). These results suggest that perceiving harm in immorality is intuitive and does not require effortful rationalization. This interpretation argues against both standard interpretations of moral dumbfounding and domain-specific theories of morality that assume the psychological existence of harmless wrongs. Dyadic completion also suggests that moral dilemmas in which wrongness (deontology) and harm (utilitarianism) conflict are unrepresentative of typical moral cognition.}

  abstract = {A scale measuring the desire for privacy as an individual difference variable was developed. The desire for privacy was treated as a unitary construct with many aspects. Based on theories of privacy, the private person was described as one who prefers greater control over interaction and personal information, more often chooses to be inaccessible, and withholds more personal information. As well as desiring greater amounts of privacy, the private person places greater importance on obtaining it.    Forty-two items employing seven-point bipolar response scales were constructed. The items referred to states of privacy and privacy-related behaviors. Undergraduate students provided data for the pilot test and subsequent stages of testing.    The final version of the Desire for Privacy Scale contains 25 items. An internal consistency coefficient of.79 and a test-retest correlation of.80 were obtained. As expected, the Desire for Privacy Scale correlated positively with a privacy preference scale, and negatively with measures of extraversion, sociability, and self-disclosure. Correlations with shyness and loneliness were positive and unexpectedly large. Partial correlations between the desire for privacy and loneliness controlling for shyness and extraversion were smaller but still substantial. Possible explanations are suggested. Among dormitory residents, high desire for privacy was found to be associated with the perception of the dormitory space as inadequate and dissatisfaction with the amount of privacy in the dormitory. High desire for privacy subjects were more likely than those with low desire for privacy scores to prefer living in a house or apartment to living in a dormitory.    The possibility that there are different types of private people, who vary in the extent to which they chose privacy or are compelled to seek it, is raised.},

Additionally, to examine the political trust of American Indians, an understudied racial minority. Methods Bivariate and multivariate analysis of 2004 and 2008 National Annenberg Election Study survey data. Results Self-designation as a racial minority exercises small, inconsistent effects on the standard measures of political trust and external efficacy. When citizens are asked whether Caucasian government officials make decisions on spending and hiring to advantage whites to the disadvantage of blacks and Hispanics, racial minorities state that they expect racial bias. American Indians reveal levels of political trust similar to those held by other racial minorities. Conclusion An increasingly multiracial society will experience considerable tensions as minorities distrust government decisionmakers of a different race. These tensions will continue to be exploited by ambitious political elites.},

Situational demands upon privacy were varied by means of a self-disclosure task in which subjects discussed relatively intimate or nonintimate topics. The findings showed that for those with high compared with low privacy preference, interaction with a stranger was rated as significantly more awkward, tense, and unnatural. High-privacy individuals verbally reinforced speaking by the strangers significantly less than low-privacy individuals. The manipulation of situational demands upon privacy did not significantly affect interpersonal attraction or interaction. The results of this study support previous research which has suggested that people with a high preference for privacy may interact less and be less comfortable with strangers than people with a low preference.},

Second, the HEXACO-100 factor scales showed fairly low intercorrelations, with only one pair of scales (Honesty–Humility and Agreeableness) having an absolute correlation above .20 in self-report data. Third, the factor and facet scales showed strong self/observer convergent correlations, which far exceeded the self/observer discriminant correlations.},

Hierarchical regression models analyzed data from a national sample of 419 adult Internet users. The analyses showed strong predictive powers of user knowledge, as indicated by the three discrete dimensions, on privacy control behavior. However, the findings were mixed when accounting for the interaction between knowledge and Internet experiences. There were limitations on the extents of knowledge and action related to personalized information. Furthermore, those limitations divided with sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, and education. Ramifications for the current status of the FTC policy are discussed.},

The findings suggest a need for caution in using the SDQ as a self-report measure for children below the age of 13, and highlight considerations of readability in measure development, selection and interpretation.

  abstract = {The field of psychology, including cognitive science, is vexed by a crisis of confidence. Although the causes and solutions are varied, we focus here on a common logical problem in inference. The default mode of inference is significance testing, which has a free lunch property where researchers need not make detailed assumptions about the alternative to test the null hypothesis. We present the argument that there is no free lunch; that is, valid testing requires that researchers test the null against a well-specified alternative. We show how this requirement follows from the basic tenets of conventional and Bayesian probability. Moreover, we show in both the conventional and Bayesian framework that not specifying the alternative may lead to rejections of the null hypothesis with scant evidence. We review both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to specifying alternatives, and we show how such specifications improve inference. The field of cognitive science will benefit because consideration of reasonable alternatives will undoubtedly sharpen the intellectual underpinnings of research.}

  abstract = {"If you've got nothing to hide," many people say, "you shouldn't worry about government surveillance." Others argue that we must sacrifice privacy for security. But as Daniel J. Solove argues in this important book, these arguments and many others are flawed. They are based on mistaken views about what it means to protect privacy and the costs and benefits of doing so. The debate between privacy and security has been framed incorrectly as a zero-sum game in which we are forced to choose between one value and the other. Why can't we have both? In this concise and accessible book, Solove exposes the fallacies of many pro-security arguments that have skewed law and policy to favor security at the expense of privacy. Protecting privacy isn't fatal to security measures; it merely involves adequate oversight and regulation. Solove traces the history of the privacy-security debate from the Revolution to the present day. He explains how the law protects privacy and examines concerns with new technologies. He then points out the failings of our current system and offers specific remedies. Nothing to Hide makes a powerful and compelling case for reaching a better balance between privacy and security and reveals why doing so is essential to protect our freedom and democracy.},

Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology's near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},
