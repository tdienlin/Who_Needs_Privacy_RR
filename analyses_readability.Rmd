Below, we develop several new items for need for privacy. To validate items, we follow the procedure implemented by @patalayAssessingReadabilitySelfreported2018 and calculate the following four reading scores: Flesch–Kincaid reading grade (FK), Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Coleman Liau Index (CLI), and the Powers-Sumner-Kearl Variation of the Dale and Chall Readability formula (DC).

To have a benchmark, we calculated the readability of the HEXACO items. It was as follows:

```{r}
items_hexaco <- c(

Readability was good. The results means that, on average, understanding the items requires seven years of schooling.

# Privacy from Government

 - I need government agencies to respect my privacy, even if that hinders a greater societal cause, such as catching criminals.
 - I don’t want the government to gather information about me, even if that makes it more difficult for them to spend tax income efficiently.
 - I don’t want government agencies to monitor my personal communication, even if doing so prevents future terrorist attacks.
 - I feel I need to protect my privacy from government agencies. 

```{r}
items_old <- c(
 "I need government agencies to respect my privacy, even if that hinders a greater societal cause, such as catching criminals.",
 "I don’t want the government to gather information about me, even if that makes it more difficult for them to spend tax income efficiently.",
 "I don’t want government agencies to monitor my personal communication, even if doing so prevents future terrorist attacks.",
 "I feel I need to protect my privacy from government agencies."
)
readability(items_old) %>% rbind(readability_hexaco)
```

Items 1, 2 and 3 show rather high scores. Try to formulate easier.

New items:

 - I need government agencies to respect my privacy, even if that makes catching criminals harder.,
 - I don’t want the government to gather data about me, even if that makes it harder to spend tax income efficiently.,
 - I don’t want government agencies to monitor my communication, even if that prevents terrorist attacks.,
 - I feel I need to protect my privacy from government agencies.
  
```{r}
items_new <- c(
 "I need government agencies to respect my privacy, even if that makes catching criminals harder.",
 "I don’t want the government to gather data about me, even if that makes it harder to spend tax income efficiently.",
  "I don’t want government agencies to track my communication, even if that stops terrorist attacks.",
  "I feel I need to protect my privacy from government agencies."
)
readability(items_new) %>% rbind(readability_hexaco)
```

A bit better, but not much.

```{r}
model <- "NFP_GOV =~ NFP_GOV_01 + NFP_GOV_02 + NFP_GOV_03 + NFP_GOV_04"
```

# Privacy from other People

 - My need for privacy is so strong that it prevents me from using social media actively. 
 - I don’t feel I need to tell my friends all my secrets.
 - I feel I need to protect my privacy from other people.
 - I prefer it when others don’t know much about me.
 
```{r}
items <- c(
 "My need for privacy is so strong that it prevents me from using social media actively.",
 "I don’t feel I need to tell my friends all my secrets.",
 "I feel I need to protect my privacy from other people.",
 "I prefer it when others don’t know much about me."
)
readability(items) %>% rbind(readability_hexaco)
```

Readability looks good!

```{r}
model <- "NFP_INT =~ NFP_INT_01 + NFP_INT_02 + NFP_INT_03 + NFP_INT_04"
```

# Privacy need anonymity

 - I need to be able to use a fake account on social network sites to preserve my privacy. 
 - I feel I need to avoid places with video surveillance.
 - I prefer not to carry my drivers license or ID with me all the time to preserve my privacy.
 - I need to be able to surf the Internet anonymously. (new)
 
```{r}
items <- c(
 "I need to be able to use a fake account on social network sites to preserve my privacy.",
 "I feel I need to avoid places with video surveillance.",
 "I prefer not to carry my drivers license or ID with me all the time to preserve my privacy.",
 "I need to be able to surf the Internet anonymously."
)
readability(items) %>% rbind(readability_hexaco)
```

Readability looks good!

```{r}
model <- "NFP_ANO =~ NFP_ANO_01 + NFP_ANO_02 + NFP_ANO_03 + NFP_ANO_04"
```


# Privacy from Companies

 - I’m willing to pay more for products or services so that companies don’t have to sell my data.
 - I’m happy to give up a little bit of privacy, so that I can use certain apps or services for free.
 - I don’t want companies to gather information about me, even if that reduces the quality of their services.
 - I feel I need to protect my privacy from companies.

```{r}
items <- c(
 "I’m willing to pay more for products or services so that companies don’t have to sell my data.",
 "I’m happy to give up a little bit of privacy, so that I can use certain apps or services for free.",
 "I don’t want companies to collect data about me, even if that makes their services worse.",
 "I feel I need to protect my privacy from companies."
)
readability(items) %>% rbind(readability_hexaco)
```

Items 3 seems to be a bit too difficult. Try to make easier.

```{r}
items <- c(
 "I’m willing to pay more for products or services so that companies don’t have to sell my data.",
 "I’m happy to give up a little bit of privacy, so that I can use certain apps or services for free.",
 "I don’t want companies to gather information about me, even if that lowers the quality of their services.",
 "I feel I need to protect my privacy from companies."
)
readability(items) %>% rbind(readability_hexaco)
```

Readability now much better.

```{r}
model <- "NFP_COM =~ NFP_COM_01 + NFP_COM_02 + NFP_COM_03 + NFP_COM_04"
```

# General Need for privacy

 - I need a lot of privacy.
 - Privacy is very important to me.
 - I think a lot about how I can protect my privacy.
 - I need a lot of time for myself.

```{r}
items <- c(
  "I need a lot of privacy.",
  "Privacy is very important to me.",
  "I think a lot about how I can protect my privacy.",
  "I need a lot of time for myself."
)
readability(items) %>% rbind(readability_hexaco)
```

Readability was good.
